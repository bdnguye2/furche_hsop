00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.240
Hello.

2
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.440
Jeffrey: So if Brian doesn't come on

3
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:48.420
Jeffrey: I'll be leaving for at least the beginning he has to take his car into the shop for the fix

4
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.730
Jeffrey: So,

5
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.490
Jeffrey: First things first.

6
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:46.110
Jeffrey: So off of Wednesday, Brian had assigned all of you a little assignment for some of the calculations. So he went over how to do the calculation for the geometry optimization and energies for water using the PB functional and the depth to SVP basis that's

7
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.420
Jeffrey: A couple of you ended up having a bit of trouble. Both switching the functional and the basis sets.

8
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.900
Jeffrey: There if you

9
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.130
Jeffrey: Have any trouble with during that time since then.

10
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.540
Theresa Carlos: I emailed Diane, actually, because

11
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.340
Theresa Carlos: When I tried doing it a Chinese name and then

12
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.140
Theresa Carlos: It said it said that the file that the fallen.

13
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.940
Jeffrey: Oh, that's still happening right

14
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.500
Jeffrey: Yeah, bizarre if you share screen. Let me see the Eric, please.

15
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.880
All right.

16
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.320
Jeffrey: So key record missing, right.

17
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:00.510
Jeffrey: So,

18
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.540
Jeffrey: If you press Control see

19
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.290
You can

20
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.170
Jeffrey: Get out of the phone.

21
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:18.960
Jeffrey: Okay, so if you're in any of these like programs. If you press Control. See, then I'll just exit out an athlete.

22
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:27.000
Jeffrey: So let's start with doing a cat ca T space cord.

23
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.570
Jeffrey: Will see what's inside the file right now.

24
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.830
Jeffrey: Cannot find input file water X rays.

25
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.370
Jeffrey: Look, here's let's try LS them.

26
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.590
Jeffrey: Okay.

27
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.850
See

28
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.210
Jeffrey: Is the water x, y, z file inside your geo opt water directory

29
00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.910
Theresa Carlos: Inside

30
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.550
Jeffrey: What's inside there. Okay.

31
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:10.980
Jeffrey: So let's copy that file into the current directory that you're in. So let's see the entire again.

32
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.610
Jeffrey: Alice

33
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.540
Jeffrey: And let's ice cream.

34
00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.270
Jeffrey: Can you cut water XYZ

35
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.480
Jeffrey: Okay, so

36
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.940
See

37
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.640
Jeffrey: All right. In that case, I think that you should probably

38
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.470
Jeffrey: Rebuild the water and the guy drove

39
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.190
Jeffrey: To generate a new water XYZ

40
00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:01.140
Jeffrey: Because it looks like the file type is different than it should be. So we can see that screen there.

41
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:08.220
Jeffrey: So when you have the XYZ file, it should still be a white text file.

42
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.470
Jeffrey: So let's see.

43
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.210
This

44
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:31.500
Jeffrey: So what I would do would be just to CD back into so CD space. Period. Period. So go back in the previous directory. Open up again.

45
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.210
Jeffrey: And then

46
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:35.250
Jeffrey: Rebuild the water

47
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.020
In there.

48
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:48.450
Jeffrey: Oh what I think is happening is that when you generated the file inside the directory above

49
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:55.050
Jeffrey: That court file actually ends up not having any right now because

50
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.560
Jeffrey: You wrote in your ex to tea.

51
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.960
Jeffrey: Water the XYZ

52
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:14.100
Jeffrey: You know, to convert the file from an XYZ file to a turbo more file and then you put that into court but because your water that XYZ isn't in the directory that you use that in

53
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:34.260
Jeffrey: So if we type ls again because the upside, the file isn't in here, what you wrote into court was actually just nothing. So, x two t saw that. Okay. There's nothing called water XYZ. So what I wrote in the cord was just something that

54
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.710
Jeffrey: It's just in this case empty.

55
00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:55.140
Jeffrey: So if you have a guardrail below the water again generate the XYZ file and then use the X TT. What are the XYZ into court again then at that point record should end up having the

56
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:57.450
correct format.

57
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.400
Jeffrey: So yeah, just a bit to try that out.

58
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.500
Jeffrey: And anyone else with any troubles.

59
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:12.870
No.

60
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:22.890
Jeffrey: Okay, I'm actually Teresa, did he end up getting any of the other any other calculations. So

61
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.010
Theresa Carlos: Maybe does every time I try to do it. It's about it.

62
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.330
Jeffrey: Right, yeah. So

63
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.990
Jeffrey: So just try to rebuild and then

64
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.480
Jeffrey: At that point it should work.

65
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.760
Jeffrey: Okay, so

66
00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:01.890
Jeffrey: So everyone else. I ended up generating all the other geometry optimization energy calculations.

67
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.340
Jeffrey: So just to double check.

68
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.520
Jeffrey: We have the directory

69
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:16.080
Jeffrey: The working directory in which we did all these calculations and for each calculation Brian had suggested that

70
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.500
Jeffrey: Oh, it's not so much suggest that then

71
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:26.100
Jeffrey: Effectively, like a requirement for making sure that your stuff is organized

72
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.150
Jeffrey: You all make different directories for each of the calculations. Right.

73
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:38.760
Jeffrey: So when you had the original calculation with PB ends up to the SVP they had something like PB as a name.

74
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.420
Jeffrey: So that everyone like organized the directories and

75
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:26.730
Okay.

76
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:29.130
Jeffrey: So,

77
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.010
Jeffrey: So I'll share screen really quick.

78
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.610
Jeffrey: Okay, so this point.

79
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.210
Jeffrey: If we have all the calculations done

80
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:52.590
Jeffrey: So if we have the geometry optimizations done

81
00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.270
Jeffrey: For each of the calculations.

82
00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.840
Jeffrey: If we do the job x

83
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.390
Jeffrey: Calculation.

84
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:11.070
Jeffrey: Then what ends up happening is that turtle will change what's written inside cord.

85
00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.220
Jeffrey: So if we do a geometry optimization

86
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.340
Jeffrey: Were putting into terrible our original core file.

87
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:27.420
Jeffrey: And then turbo will will spit out the optimized cord file based on whichever calculation that you ran

88
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.340
Jeffrey: So,

89
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:35.220
Jeffrey: If you ran the Jiangxi optimization will say PV versus TP SSH.

90
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:43.800
Jeffrey: You can typically expect to have a different court file but spit out

91
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.900
Jeffrey: Because you're using a different method of doing your calculation.

92
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:57.090
Jeffrey: So what we can do from here is that within each of your directories. So say PV versus TPS sh.

93
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:59.940
Jeffrey: We can take that core file.

94
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:09.750
Jeffrey: And do the same thing that we did at the beginning. So at the beginning, we took our water the XYZ file us x TT

95
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.040
Jeffrey: What are the XYZ to spit into a report file.

96
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.560
Jeffrey: We can do the exact opposite.

97
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.450
Jeffrey: So instead of x TT, we can use t to x.

98
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.180
Jeffrey: And then take that Word file.

99
00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.800
Jeffrey: And now we'll write it into say

100
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:30.660
Jeffrey: Optimized

101
00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.700
Jeffrey: Other say art water XYZ

102
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:39.600
Jeffrey: Oh,

103
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:41.640
Jeffrey: Okay.

104
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:52.530
Jeffrey: So if we can all try this on at least the TPS or inside the PBN to SVP

105
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:54.750
Jeffrey: Run that we did on Wednesday.

106
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:13.410
Jeffrey: So after you run this T two x cord into water XYZ if we Ellis again.

107
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:18.090
Jeffrey: We'll see that the water dot x, y, z found has been created.

108
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:22.470
Jeffrey: Okay.

109
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:41.340
Jeffrey: So I'll be have gadget downloaded, of course, because he generated, the water, the XYZ file. So what we can do in order to look at what the structure of water is after we did the geometry optimization we can open up avocado gun.

110
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.100
Jeffrey: So I apologize. You open here.

111
00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.350
Jeffrey: And we'll try to open one of these files.

112
00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.500
Jeffrey: So, at least in my case.

113
00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:03.390
Jeffrey: What I would want to be doing is to

114
00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:12.060
Jeffrey: Remember where this file is so what I would write down

115
00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:39.720
Jeffrey: So I know that my opt water the XYZ file is in this path on this directory. So, for me at least I have J EFF party seven that model 60 FPS that UCLA.

116
00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.780
Jeffrey: And we have a colon and then we have to work.

117
00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.900
Jeffrey: At the party seven such water.

118
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.420
Jeffrey: And then the file name that we want is the upward

119
00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:12.120
Jeffrey: So make note of where you put your ops water x, y, z file.

120
00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:17.940
Jeffrey: Just take a look at the chat for my example.

121
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.980
Jeffrey: The way that you can figure it out for years is you'll have it right here.

122
00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:30.780
Jeffrey: Except after the model six or whatever name and computer is we have the PS that UCI

123
00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:38.190
Jeffrey: So what I'll do now, is I'll close the connection.

124
00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:41.100
Jeffrey: Sorry.

125
00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:42.930
Jeffrey: Is everyone

126
00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:44.340
Jeffrey: All right.

127
00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.430
Jeffrey: Okay, so I'll close the connection to SSH.

128
00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.010
Jeffrey: It gets Control D.

129
00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:56.910
Jeffrey: So if you press control the oldest lobby up

130
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.260
Jeffrey: And

131
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:13.380
Jeffrey: I'll be navigating to a working directory inside my own computer. So in the Windows case I have the mountains. See

132
00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.110
Jeffrey: Wherever you ended up putting your

133
00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:21.420
Jeffrey: Files.

134
00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.640
Jeffrey: Just wondering, does everyone have a working directory on their local machine.

135
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.970
Aakrsh: Have one

136
00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:53.760
Jeffrey: Place to put your folders. I mean, put your files on your own computer.

137
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.050
Jeffrey: Yeah, that you can navigate to that.

138
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:08.910
Jeffrey: So it could be somewhere where you put the avocado x, y, z file when you made it on the computer.

139
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:32.910
Jeffrey: Make a call.

140
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.480
Jeffrey: If you already have a place to put it.

141
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:38.640
Jeffrey: Just navigate over

142
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.330
Jeffrey: So,

143
00:18:56.190 --> 00:19:05.700
Jeffrey: Brian likes to ask your questions. So what was the command. So if we want to take the S. The, the x, y, z file from

144
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:17.310
Jeffrey: Where we have it on the manufacturing here. So whatever model six or whatever. And we want to transfer over to Eric curtain here. What's the command for that.

145
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:28.650
Theresa Carlos: And then

146
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:38.400
Jeffrey: So we'll have SPP SCP

147
00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:43.530
Jeffrey: And then we'll put in whatever file that we want to take out

148
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:49.320
Jeffrey: So from what I have in the chat here. I'll just type in

149
00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:21.600
Jeffrey: So I've typed in typed in the address for the XYZ followed. I want to transfer over to my computer.

150
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:25.350
Jeffrey: And then

151
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:31.980
Jeffrey: We put the destination. So if you've already navigated to the directory that you want to put the file into

152
00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.600
Jeffrey: We'll just see period for the current directory that we're in.

153
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:42.570
Jeffrey: Put on your password and transfer it over.

154
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.150
Jeffrey: And if I LS, then I'll see the file then subway director

155
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:20.340
Jeffrey: Years and years that popped up.

156
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.100
Theresa Carlos: For me, it said

157
00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:35.220
Theresa Carlos: I didn't show like I didn't show that I had to put in a password manager so

158
00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:38.880
Jeffrey: copied over

159
00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:46.260
Theresa Carlos: It yeah usage and then as CP, and then a bunch of numbers and safer.

160
00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:53.760
Jeffrey: If you just take hours with the file culture, your directory

161
00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:00.060
Jeffrey: Or did not successfully successfully copy over

162
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:03.720
Theresa Carlos: Again,

163
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.110
Jeffrey: As RPC chest

164
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:30.840
Hello, can I see the full screen.

165
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:54.840
Jeffrey: Okay, so there is just one thing that you ended up missing here for the previous line.

166
00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:58.800
Jeffrey: So if you ever want to redo one of the

167
00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:11.880
Jeffrey: Commands that you did before. You can use the arrow keys. So if you press up twice on your arrow keys. Right. So there we go. So that way I don't like copy paste there anything about

168
00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:17.280
Jeffrey: Okay, so you have the SVP SCP

169
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:22.890
Jeffrey: And then you have the location of the file that you want to copy over

170
00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:30.090
Jeffrey: So is one thing missing at the end that you'll need to add on.

171
00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:36.780
Jeffrey: And open up to everyone. If you can print out what she needs to add

172
00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.620
Theresa Carlos: Yeah, so it's just the beginning of the end

173
00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:43.200
Theresa Carlos: I mean, yeah.

174
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.950
Jeffrey: So,

175
00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.500
Jeffrey: So you can leave the line alone.

176
00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:58.620
Jeffrey: Because you've already pointed out where the

177
00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.070
Jeffrey: file that you want to copy over is

178
00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:08.430
Jeffrey: So I would say delete the period that you have that that you added

179
00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:31.230
Jeffrey: So yep so this is the dust and this is the location on the file. So what you have to specify at the end of the line here is the destination.

180
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:33.900
Jeffrey: So if you go all the way to the end.

181
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:38.070
Jeffrey: And then, hello.

182
00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.000
Jeffrey: Space period.

183
00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:48.870
Jeffrey: should protect your password.

184
00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.260
Okay, awesome.

185
00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:00.960
OK.

186
00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:12.720
Jeffrey: So the location of your file might be different from where I had it. So for me, I just had it in a work my name.

187
00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:13.620
Water

188
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:24.390
Jeffrey: But was there a different directory inside of water that you put fear of water. Oh yeah, that you put the water. Water that XYZ talented.

189
00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.170
Theresa Carlos: Houses check it again. Yeah.

190
00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:28.800
Sounds good.

191
00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:34.590
Brian Nguyen: May I may add something to

192
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.900
Brian Nguyen: Hello. Oh, yes. Okay. Hey, guys.

193
00:25:41.190 --> 00:26:01.740
Brian Nguyen: One last thing is that also keep notes take notes that you're wanting to use the computer that you've been using okay alright so double check that. Another thing I think there is a you mentioned FTP dash are right. So what is the dash our option do

194
00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:04.290
Brian Nguyen: Allows you to do.

195
00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:08.760
Theresa Carlos: Sure.

196
00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:14.160
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so does anyone. Is anyone else know what that art can be

197
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.540
Brian Nguyen: We had a crush on in Victoria.

198
00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:36.600
Brian Nguyen: I think I

199
00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:40.320
Aakrsh: Mean

200
00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:47.700
Aakrsh: Something to do doesn't like real not rewrite but doesn't really change the like.

201
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.090
Aakrsh: Remember, we can do

202
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.710
Yeah, yesterday.

203
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:54.600
Brian Nguyen: Yeah.

204
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:55.200
Aakrsh: It like

205
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:04.680
Aakrsh: It doesn't change, like the room when you like LS dash l it you can finally think about it, doesn't it, change it to like

206
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.260
Aakrsh: Change the restrictions on it.

207
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:14.700
Brian Nguyen: Ah, OK. So there's a lot of commands, where we're learning this week. If you do

208
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:26.490
Brian Nguyen: Anything LS dash space dash l that this gives you more information with directory. Right. So those ashes are will options for your command.

209
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:48.060
Brian Nguyen: Special option so FTP is to copy is very similar to CP okay but Sep can do remote copy that from one computer to another. The dash R stands for recursive a allows you to copy folders directories. Okay.

210
00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:51.150
Brian Nguyen: You don't need to have that options always

211
00:27:52.380 --> 00:28:00.150
Brian Nguyen: Written typed out in your command, you only need to be ready now for your actually copying directories and folders. Okay.

212
00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:06.390
Brian Nguyen: Keep in mind. All right. Jesse questions I had for you guys.

213
00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:15.540
Jeffrey: So I'm not sure if we've brought this up before, but if you ever need to check with these options do the dash and then the letter or a number

214
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:26.850
Jeffrey: You can type in man for manual ma n space and then your command. So in this case I typed in men space SCP

215
00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:36.780
Jeffrey: And that will bring up all the options that you can add on, say, the command. So you'll see something that looks like.

216
00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:44.220
Jeffrey: At the top will say SCP and then name Sep secure copy

217
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:51.930
Jeffrey: And if you want to scroll down you can just keep hustling, hold on to the returner Enter key.

218
00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:56.430
Jeffrey: And I one point you'll end up seeing this that are

219
00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:03.510
Jeffrey: And you'll see that it says that are personally copy entire directories.

220
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:09.780
Jeffrey: It's an

221
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:14.790
Jeffrey: Alpha numerical order to so should fall just alphabet.

222
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.130
Jeffrey: So, this applies that all these different

223
00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:28.020
Jeffrey: All these different functions, including LS so you can see what LS dash l LS dash a all those options there.

224
00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:33.390
Jeffrey: And then if you want to exit the manual will see at the bottom of your

225
00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.380
Jeffrey: terminal screen just press cutie but

226
00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:51.480
Okay.

227
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:53.130
Jeffrey: So,

228
00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:58.920
Okay.

229
00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.870
Jeffrey: So at this point we can open up other data.

230
00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:23.220
Jeffrey: So Brian, we just, we just converted the court file from the TV that TCP SVP on to XYZ now again come over. So we'll be opening up

231
00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:30.090
Jeffrey: Make sure that

232
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:38.430
Jeffrey: Sure school

233
00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.280
Jeffrey: And evolve your

234
00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:56.400
Jeffrey: Resume received the

235
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:58.470
Jeffrey: Pool sheets.

236
00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:01.440
Jeffrey: For the water and Brian

237
00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:06.660
Brian Nguyen: Oh, I have to test that.

238
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:13.590
Jeffrey: Actually, I don't have a busy well as myself, so yeah.

239
00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:19.560
Brian Nguyen: Okay, I'll send it out.

240
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:22.200
Jeffrey: So there's

241
00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:23.880
Jeffrey: The

242
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:46.200
Jeffrey: Okay, so I'll just open up the files so file open and then make sure that you remembered where you put your file, so I'll be navigating my

243
00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:16.080
Jeffrey: So just like when you made the molecule before it once you open up the x, y, z found you should see the water pop up Kim.

244
00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:40.530
Jeffrey: And just give me a quick nothing

245
00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:10.530
Jeffrey: Okay.

246
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:15.840
Jeffrey: So on the other screen.

247
00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:21.270
Jeffrey: You'll see that there is this toolbar here.

248
00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:31.740
Jeffrey: So what we have selected right yet right now is the navigation tool so sweat allows us to just rotate this and looking at all angles.

249
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:34.380
Jeffrey: Now,

250
00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.750
Jeffrey: To the right of the other organizations will will see a clip to measure.

251
00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:54.960
Jeffrey: So if we hover over that will see that left most books. So if we select two different items, they'll give us the distance between the two hours.

252
00:33:56.010 --> 00:34:00.270
Jeffrey: And if we select three different items. Then I'll give us an angle.

253
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:04.650
Jeffrey: Okay, so if I try this here.

254
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:15.180
Jeffrey: On a hydrogen and oxygen will see that the distance of point 911 instruments what pops up.

255
00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:20.880
Jeffrey: Okay, actually ran the calculation.

256
00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:30.870
Jeffrey: And if I just like the other hydrogen, then they'll give me the angle between them.

257
00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:39.240
Jeffrey: So this point.

258
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:45.120
Jeffrey: So Brian's send out the goal sheet with the

259
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:47.490
Jeffrey: mentioned a lot it

260
00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:49.770
Jeffrey: So will be

261
00:34:50.910 --> 00:34:55.200
Jeffrey: So if you could open that up. And once I see everyone's

262
00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.750
Jeffrey: Open it up on the principles.

263
00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:26.880
Brian Nguyen: It's possible to make your avocado, a little bit figure

264
00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:31.110
Brian Nguyen: Don't think you can see a number

265
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.510
Jeffrey: Or can you just like, Okay. Oh.

266
00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:43.980
Jeffrey: I'm not sure.

267
00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:52.650
Brian Nguyen: There is an option in avocado. When you hear

268
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:54.660
Brian Nguyen: Find

269
00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.310
Brian Nguyen: Pulled out think you had to go to build

270
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.020
Brian Nguyen: Or do you

271
00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:14.730
Brian Nguyen: Want to go to Properties The bottle cap. There's a long

272
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:19.110
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, the bond properties for angle properly so

273
00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:25.020
Brian Nguyen: Okay. All right. So that's one way and then open another one. And you can see the angles.

274
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:35.460
Brian Nguyen: So there's there's two ways to do this.

275
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:45.810
Brian Nguyen: Alright, alright.

276
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:54.540
Jeffrey: So I'll take NOT THAT MY FAMILY SAYS HERE, BUT 911 and then angle is 67.2

277
00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:59.550
Jeffrey: So, going over to the Google Sheet that yes

278
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.530
Jeffrey: So he's done all the calculations for all the basis sets and all the methods.

279
00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:11.610
Jeffrey: So we can compare what we ended up getting with abundance and bond angles to what he got

280
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:15.030
Jeffrey: So here

281
00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:22.500
Jeffrey: For original calculation, we end up using PV and depth to SVP

282
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:36.150
Jeffrey: So we'll see the bottom line is 0.975 year comparison by 0.911

283
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:45.840
Jeffrey: So I guess a question that we can pose here is, why do you think that is one link ended up being

284
00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.530
Jeffrey: Longer than the one day and get it.

285
00:37:58.350 --> 00:37:58.590
Jeffrey: Well,

286
00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:06.750
Jeffrey: Considering what happened last last quarter. Last, last but I think this might be something we're

287
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:14.280
Actually

288
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:30.150
Jeffrey: I think what ended up happening was a Oh okay, that's what happened. Okay, so I wrote the director water geology often than that because I didn't have I'll go to another computer

289
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:37.440
Jeffrey: So rather than building it on the dojo I just took the optimized structure and then

290
00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:39.420
Paste the

291
00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.060
Jeffrey: surfer everyone else.

292
00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:52.170
Jeffrey: Where the bond distances that you got pretty close to this brand.

293
00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:04.260
Jeffrey: Okay, and

294
00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:10.380
Jeffrey: Brian. Any ideas by angles. So all

295
00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.740
Brian Nguyen: The optimizer structure.

296
00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.210
Brian Nguyen: What method do

297
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:26.160
Jeffrey: So in this case, I also did the BB and the depth. Yes.

298
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:30.810
Brian Nguyen: Okay, I don't think he ran the job next to

299
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:32.490
Jeffrey: It.

300
00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:34.110
Okay.

301
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:39.720
Jeffrey: And I just do want to open up yours.

302
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:44.790
Jeffrey: So we can see the ones that correspond to what we have here.

303
00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.030
Brian Nguyen: Oh my. Yeah.

304
00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:49.920
Brian Nguyen: Well, I

305
00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:55.950
Brian Nguyen: Want to ask that if students is either here, their calculations.

306
00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:58.980
Brian Nguyen: You might be going a little fast.

307
00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:00.690
Brian Nguyen: So,

308
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:02.880
Brian Nguyen: Trace

309
00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:05.790
Brian Nguyen: The Korea.

310
00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.450
Brian Nguyen: We do get bond distances.

311
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:29.190
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, feel free to, you know, to stop us. Right. So we want to. I'm going to try to, we're going to try to go a little slower, this time.

312
00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:39.600
Brian Nguyen: We got able to copy the files over or was there a problem.

313
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:48.240
Brian Nguyen: That we

314
00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:53.490
Brian Nguyen: Will need some feedback here. You know, it's important to just communicate

315
00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:27.810
Brian Nguyen: Yes.

316
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:34.980
Brian Nguyen: All right. Anyone ever wanted to see the bond distances to match up you know

317
00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:44.130
Brian Nguyen: You know, it's just kind of oftentimes in science, I'd be able to repeat calculations are repeat the experiment.

318
00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:46.770
Brian Nguyen: Or the results consistent

319
00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:53.370
Theresa Carlos: With what we've been in the news.

320
00:41:54.930 --> 00:42:05.130
Brian Nguyen: Yeah. So I'm asking if you guys got a similar results as I got this Excel sheet for the bond dismisses for PB depth to STP.

321
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.960
Brian Nguyen: All right.

322
00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.440
Aakrsh: What is really a little bit off.

323
00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.060
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

324
00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:14.700
Brian Nguyen: What's your, what's your distances.

325
00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.430
Aakrsh: I don't point 970

326
00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:22.440
Brian Nguyen: Okay, it says type that into chat.

327
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:28.410
Brian Nguyen: And everyone protect your bond. This is in the chat, and I'll explain.

328
00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:30.690
Theresa Carlos: Are we looking at

329
00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.360
Brian Nguyen: We're looking at to bond distances.

330
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:44.790
Brian Nguyen: Because these are some of these, you know, we want to be able to compare our calculation to experimental results.

331
00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:49.890
Brian Nguyen: Because why we're doing is trying to predict what's going to actually happen in reality.

332
00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:54.510
Brian Nguyen: And I crash point 970

333
00:42:54.870 --> 00:43:00.660
Jeffrey: So these are the water, it should be symmetric. So it should be the same. It's full of

334
00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:06.630
Theresa Carlos: Minor very close, but they're

335
00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:13.980
Theresa Carlos: They're kind of like one minus point nine seven and the other one is point 969

336
00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:16.770
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

337
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:24.120
Brian Nguyen: So let's talk about what we'll talk about it, everyone put their numbers in

338
00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:29.250
Jeffrey: So yeah, you can just choose whichever one good now.

339
00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:34.080
Brian Nguyen: Okay so dancers three says, no question.

340
00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:39.480
Brian Nguyen: So these are in English drums. Okay.

341
00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.840
Brian Nguyen: If you look up the interesting strong

342
00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:51.330
Brian Nguyen: To si it's 10 to the minus 10 meters. All right, so

343
00:43:52.410 --> 00:44:07.860
Brian Nguyen: If you were to compare your point nine seven year Engstrom 2.97969 Thanks Joe. That's pretty much is not a very significant difference. Okay.

344
00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:17.370
Brian Nguyen: Typically have some the if you get for bond distances, you gave within you know the first two decimal places.

345
00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:26.310
Brian Nguyen: That third decimal places, very small. And there's slight differences is not not very significant. Okay.

346
00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:32.730
Brian Nguyen: So what could happen is that when we

347
00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.780
Brian Nguyen: So possibility that that could be a little different.

348
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:42.720
Brian Nguyen: Between each of our calculation. These are fairly all fairly very close

349
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:56.340
Brian Nguyen: You know there's maybe five different variations. What could it happen is when you run the calculation you guys have maybe slightly different initial starting point.

350
00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:06.720
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so you what you started out optimizing with your structure with maybe very between each of you guys until you guys may end up at different

351
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:17.550
Brian Nguyen: State minimum okay and the ground state. And they're all we've been there. We've all there that there are true ground state. Okay.

352
00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:18.180
Aakrsh: And you burn.

353
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:19.770
Brian Nguyen: Yes, fish.

354
00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:27.780
Aakrsh: Let's just say like if I, if you didn't get a good air value those like really far off. Wouldn't be the first thing you look at

355
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:46.290
Brian Nguyen: So if the errors are very far off. The very first thing you want to double check it. Make sure that you didn't make any human errors, right, like eating use the correct message. Make sure you have the correct parameters that you put in

356
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:55.170
Brian Nguyen: For control within your control file right at the very first step to kind of make sure that it you know you make sure to use

357
00:45:55.830 --> 00:46:14.850
Brian Nguyen: The users didn't put anything in. Correct. Right. Okay. And then if that's not the case, then you then start being a little bit more deeper looking at the molecular orbital of the molecule right to those type of some type of analysis, you would do. All right.

358
00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.140
Brian Nguyen: I'll publish that later on. All right.

359
00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:20.910
Brian Nguyen: But so far.

360
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.810
Brian Nguyen: Most you guys are pretty within you know less than

361
00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:39.300
Brian Nguyen: 10 to the minus two Engstrom which is fairly good pianist time you got. I got exactly the same. Chris, you got, you know, point your, your five, that's very small typically most people don't really even

362
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:46.230
Brian Nguyen: It's not significant beyond right if you think about the the unit very

363
00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:49.710
Brian Nguyen: Tall your years of slightly off.

364
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:52.140
Brian Nguyen: That's okay.

365
00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:58.680
Brian Nguyen: So this is kind of just going to have to see. Right. Sometimes there is some variation

366
00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:19.230
Brian Nguyen: What would I would probably have done property to double check my work is maybe just give you the structure I optimize. You can we optimize that structure right okay but for now. Generally, it looks like all your cases all your calculation is very similar to mine right

367
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:23.190
Brian Nguyen: How does the bond angle. Look for you guys.

368
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:29.250
Aakrsh: We keep it in the chat as well. Yeah.

369
00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:30.150
Brian Nguyen: At the in the chat.

370
00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:33.510
Brian Nguyen: So,

371
00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:44.130
Brian Nguyen: I think a few guys have taken chemistry right so water. If you look at its best structure right

372
00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:48.660
Brian Nguyen: So what what

373
00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:53.580
Brian Nguyen: What is

374
00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.730
Brian Nguyen: The 3D 3D geometry of that.

375
00:47:58.410 --> 00:47:59.460
Aakrsh: IT'S A BIG MONKEY.

376
00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:04.830
Brian Nguyen: Yes event molecule. And I believe textbook. They said, What's the bond angle.

377
00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:08.610
Aakrsh: Is approximately 109 point five missing. OK.

378
00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:20.730
Brian Nguyen: OK, so now. Just keep in mind that is just a model right it doesn't really matches up what we see in reality. Okay.

379
00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:22.260
Brian Nguyen: All right.

380
00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:26.640
Brian Nguyen: So can everyone type in your, your bond angles to

381
00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:15.270
Interesting.

382
00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:23.370
Brian Nguyen: One or two Christians get one or two time you got one or two. The trader 109 point five.

383
00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:26.730
Brian Nguyen: Almost exactly

384
00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:32.520
Brian Nguyen: What's the bondage for bond angle for an event molecule.

385
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:36.900
Brian Nguyen: Meaning Tracy at 109 point four seven

386
00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:38.940
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

387
00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:42.030
Brian Nguyen: So,

388
00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.720
Brian Nguyen: Let me check mine.

389
00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:56.280
Brian Nguyen: Check. I'm not crazy. Okay. Alright, so I got my phone and go a lot closer to a Christian ton

390
00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:58.590
Brian Nguyen: So,

391
00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:01.080
Brian Nguyen: Like we can you know for

392
00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:08.820
Brian Nguyen: The reset your recent destroy your different

393
00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.280
Brian Nguyen: All right into

394
00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:14.520
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so this can happen.

395
00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:34.770
Brian Nguyen: So one of the things we need to check right if we have all slightly different distances is to double check our geometry optimization calculation. Make sure all parameters looks correct. Okay. So what could possibly happen is with these three different methods and he has like error.

396
00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:59.430
Brian Nguyen: Does inputting to the options, double check that double check your so remember. Now, how do we check the that are structured we optimize that a in a month I re run a real force calculation and we look at vibration. Vibration or frequency. There's no negative numbers in their

397
00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:14.460
Brian Nguyen: In your frequency, then we were structured really optimize is adding ground state trooper. Okay, so, double check that Teresa and Victoria right so

398
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:17.550
Brian Nguyen: So anyways, so

399
00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:21.420
Brian Nguyen: The idea is now which one takes to bond distances.

400
00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:23.430
Brian Nguyen: You look at it.

401
00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:27.600
Brian Nguyen: Look at your bond distances.

402
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:37.320
Brian Nguyen: And you want it, then look at different basis sets, change the basis it. Okay. It doesn't change very much you're generally right

403
00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:41.880
Brian Nguyen: Some of these other methods PCs sh.

404
00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:53.700
Brian Nguyen: Change as much either, but generally most methods are very small molecules, you know, do you generally get within very similar answers. Okay.

405
00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:57.840
Brian Nguyen: This last one here is

406
00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:02.130
Brian Nguyen: A method we were in college call our tree fall

407
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:07.080
Brian Nguyen: Is one of the very first methods, people learn

408
00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:08.940
Brian Nguyen: Truly third

409
00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:12.000
Brian Nguyen: The reason why this is very slightly off.

410
00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:14.190
Brian Nguyen: The bond distances.

411
00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:18.270
Brian Nguyen: Is much more here.

412
00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:22.620
Brian Nguyen: This is slightly off.

413
00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:39.210
Brian Nguyen: Yet alright so the idea is that each method has slightly different, different answers. The reason why is,

414
00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:48.510
Brian Nguyen: We can kind of explore later on, but just the kids can get you a feel for this. Alright, so we're just kind of looked at the accuracy of these these methods.

415
00:52:49.200 --> 00:53:07.350
Brian Nguyen: And generally, we compared them to our experimental results. Alright. Thanks, Joe. Con bond angle. If you scroll down, I actually compete out the errors are just method, right. So for bond distances. You can see that

416
00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:15.600
Brian Nguyen: That archery Fox consistently under bunch over

417
00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:26.760
Brian Nguyen: I think so, yes. Under bindings right by we got teeth areas for each other methods, right, they're all within like a percent or so. Okay.

418
00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:44.400
Brian Nguyen: Jeremy all pretty good, but we can see that certain method. This method here he says if he performed very well. Right. Okay. So, so those are things to just keep in mind for as you get a feel for all right.

419
00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:50.310
Brian Nguyen: These are very standard methods that people use in the field. All right.

420
00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:55.170
Brian Nguyen: Hang on, hang on. One angles here, right.

421
00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:56.640
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

422
00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:12.270
Brian Nguyen: So I just wanted you guys to kind of explore different basis sets and different method. And generally, it looks like the basis that isn't as much of an effect.

423
00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:24.240
Brian Nguyen: On the bond distances, but it seems to have somewhat an effect on the upon angles, where they can actually change a few degrees from the basis that will come

424
00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:31.080
Brian Nguyen: To this decision as a few things to kind of just know where you're just observing right

425
00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:33.720
Brian Nguyen: In more detail.

426
00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:40.560
Brian Nguyen: Reasons and we'll have to do a little bit more investigation, you know, okay.

427
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:54.030
Brian Nguyen: Right, so then you can kind of do a sanity check on your own kind of check if you guys can get more numbers for the 70s PDP and other methods. Keep the FSH, okay.

428
00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:57.750
Brian Nguyen: Alright guys, I mean. All right y'all,

429
00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:02.670
Brian Nguyen: Question is a lot going over

430
00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:23.430
Brian Nguyen: Okay. So at the very top, you look at this, generally you want to get methods, very close to experimental results right and then I have a reference for that is a government you know reference for some of these calculations or experimental results.

431
00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:27.240
Brian Nguyen: All right. And then there are

432
00:55:28.290 --> 00:55:36.450
Brian Nguyen: One last thing that we generally do say something if you don't have the experimental results. How do we kind of verify well

433
00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:49.560
Brian Nguyen: What people can, can you can really try to verify things by using a very we call high level theories are very expensive calculation until you will see this was

434
00:55:50.430 --> 00:56:06.300
Brian Nguyen: The feast at St. Francis at all right. This is a low of this is a message or a level theory that is very expensive to use I generally in the field, people use this as a reference.

435
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:10.650
Brian Nguyen: As the reference for being the most accurate. Okay.

436
00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:14.970
Brian Nguyen: I put in air quotes the most accurate.

437
00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:16.950
Brian Nguyen: Because

438
00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:35.400
Brian Nguyen: We don't know. We can't verify that. Okay. Sometimes this method may not perform very well for certain experiments. But in this case, maybe compared to bond distances and bond angle their bases essentially the same. Right.

439
00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:40.920
Brian Nguyen: So in this case, we can say that this method.

440
00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:45.210
Brian Nguyen: Is kind of, we call it the gold standard. Okay.

441
00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:47.970
Brian Nguyen: guys have questions there.

442
00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:55.350
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so it's it's safe to say that we can use this method to compare

443
00:56:57.090 --> 00:56:58.320
Brian Nguyen: Other other methods.

444
00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:10.170
Jeffrey: Is there this kind of equivalent golden standard when it comes to the basis that rather than nothing.

445
00:57:12.690 --> 00:57:15.840
Brian Nguyen: So for eighth is that

446
00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:18.240
Brian Nguyen: Generally

447
00:57:19.290 --> 00:57:26.160
Brian Nguyen: What we want to run all our calculations in a fairly large basis that

448
00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:34.860
Brian Nguyen: Because we use a smaller basis it except to Sep okay

449
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:36.420
Brian Nguyen: Now,

450
00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:50.190
Brian Nguyen: Your areas are much larger. Okay, so what we want to generally people like to do in the field is to run a calculation that a pain complete basis set completeness.

451
00:57:51.270 --> 00:58:13.650
Brian Nguyen: And what I mean by that is, as you go up into bigger basis it from SVP PvP PvP that your, your calculator results doesn't change as much right and you can see for some of them actually, you know, different a bond efficiency. They're almost very basic def complete basis that limit. Okay.

452
00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:18.030
Brian Nguyen: All right. You can see the how they are very close. All right.

453
00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:24.690
Brian Nguyen: Questions, they're

454
00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:30.000
Brian Nguyen: All right. Look everyone got

455
00:58:31.590 --> 00:58:32.430
Brian Nguyen: To see you got that.

456
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:34.350
Brian Nguyen: All right.

457
00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:58.620
Brian Nguyen: I think maybe we can in the next, you know, is minister, so you guys can practice and get the file for TV def two TVs up on your own without be fine with you guys. So, and it's to do that so you guys can get a feel how the workflow is going to go right maybe compared compared to to

458
00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:00.330
Brian Nguyen: Excel sheet.

459
00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:10.050
Brian Nguyen: Right, so it's just this do five minutes, you know guys work on your own kind of copy the file. Hopefully you guys ran the calculation.

460
00:59:11.130 --> 00:59:17.280
Brian Nguyen: If you guys couldn't run the calculations. Just, just feel free to reach out to say ask question right

461
00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:23.730
Theresa Carlos: Yeah, I wasn't able to run the calculation. Because when I tried to do it.

462
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:25.560
Theresa Carlos: It's about

463
00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:33.600
Theresa Carlos: Corn, for instance, even though this isn't okay

464
00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:39.840
Brian Nguyen: All right, so 358 tactic. But after question on hold that will get to you.

465
00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:43.980
Brian Nguyen: Chris time Victoria.

466
00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:45.210
Creek.

467
00:59:46.410 --> 00:59:48.660
Brian Nguyen: Question. We've given you the calculation.

468
00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:01.950

Brian Nguyen: Or

488
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:35.340
Brian Nguyen: Go back to my folder. All right. Okay. So we all know the command is called SCP correct

489
01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:41.670
Brian Nguyen: The next thing you want to do is type in your user type in our computer

490
01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.720
Brian Nguyen: Right. And in this is where you want to put our file path.

491
01:01:52.710 --> 01:02:01.710
Brian Nguyen: Where is the, where's the file located explain that again. And then the last thing we want to do is put put the destination.

492
01:02:03.030 --> 01:02:11.700
Brian Nguyen: Okay, it says for copying from a computer because he is specify where we want to put this file on our local machine. Call it. OK.

493
01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:18.570
Brian Nguyen: OK, I just I just leave this as reference you guys

494
01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:25.140
Brian Nguyen: can ignore this. Okay, this one is just to cancel command control, see, okay.

495
01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:27.180
Brian Nguyen: So,

496
01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:28.980
Brian Nguyen: To

497
01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:32.520
Brian Nguyen: To get this file path.

498
01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:41.550
Brian Nguyen: Right, this log in to one of our computers. So what I can do is I can open a tab.

499
01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.500
Brian Nguyen: On a Mac, you can do that. I don't know about Windows

505
01:03:24.690 --> 01:03:43.590
Brian Nguyen: Home directory. So you guys think about where we were running our calculation. You're always running in the works work folder for such work orders username right for me. I believe I ran my calculation right here, Geo ops right

506
01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:49.620
Brian Nguyen: Okay, easy.

507
01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:54.090
Brian Nguyen: Task of the time STP.

508
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:58.710
Brian Nguyen: Alright, this is where my calculation is

509
01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:03.420
Brian Nguyen: And what you need to do is you need to copy this year.

510
01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:09.720
Brian Nguyen: Right now my stop share. I'm going to share my whole desktop, this time.

511
01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:20.010
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so here's my app is the directory to I want to go to

512
01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:25.620
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so let's see here. I'm going to type in my SPC

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.060
Brian Nguyen: Water I play see

517
01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:50.610
Brian Nguyen: I want to copy

518
01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:59.040

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:07.920
Brian Nguyen: name correctly. Okay. Or you might get an error. Alright. Copy that. And then destination.

520
01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:16.050

522
01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:24.810

Yes.

524
01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.160
Brian Nguyen: Alright, that's how I work.

525
01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:31.440
Brian Nguyen: I'm going to

526
01:05:32.550 --> 01:05:33.300
Brian Nguyen: cancel this

527
01:05:34.770 --> 01:05:35.760
Brian Nguyen: Leave this open

528
01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:39.600
Brian Nguyen: Copy this to the chat.

529
01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:40.860
If

530
01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:43.050
Brian Nguyen: You're aware of it.

531
01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.020
Brian Nguyen: Alright, now we're going to address that.

532
01:05:56.550 --> 01:05:57.150
Brian Nguyen: Problem.

533
01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:02.940
Brian Nguyen: For you like to

534
01:06:04.290 --> 01:06:05.190
Brian Nguyen: take a crack at this

535
01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:12.810
Jeffrey: So she did bring it up before

536
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:21.000
Jeffrey: So it looks like when she tried to generate the cord file.

537
01:06:22.110 --> 01:06:28.050
Jeffrey: She had already put the X rays, and he fell into the error directory that was made.

538
01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:31.590
Jeffrey: So when doing the X TT

539
01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:36.990
Jeffrey: There wasn't actually XYZ file to convert into the core file.

540
01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:41.160
Jeffrey: Additionally, in the air directory

541
01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:45.660
Jeffrey: The water that XYZ found the fun was in green.

542
01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:47.610
Jeffrey: Which is

543
01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:48.240
Brian Nguyen: That ok

544
01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:51.300
Jeffrey: The next section. Okay, that's fine. OK. OK.

545
01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:52.470
Jeffrey: So,

546
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:58.920
Jeffrey: My suggestion was to just rebuilt the molecule and other gadgets and regenerate the XYZ file.

547
01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:05.820
Jeffrey: So in this case, if the green is fine then it'd be fine to just

548
01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:10.620
Jeffrey: Copy that back into the original dirty. Yeah.

549
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:15.570
Brian Nguyen: Okay. Have a good faith that alpha share your screen, so everyone can see and and we

550
01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:21.780
Brian Nguyen: Go through it together is a very common air all right for everyone.

551
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:27.660
Brian Nguyen: You know you're not just the only one trees to I've done it. I send it to you before in the past.

552
01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:33.060
Brian Nguyen: Where I ran define and impress a chord and he says, Kyle not found.

553
01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:35.760
Brian Nguyen: What the right

554
01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:38.580
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so now you're here.

555
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:43.290
Brian Nguyen: What is that core file and see what is in it.

556
01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:53.040
Brian Nguyen: It is I'm going through the process go out to parents probably shoot yourself so

557
01:07:54.900 --> 01:08:07.170
Brian Nguyen: Cannot find input file water dot x, y, z, so that means that you didn't point to the file or where the file is that means to maybe

558
01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:09.180
Brian Nguyen: Get out quick

559
01:08:13.350 --> 01:08:15.000
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so my

560
01:08:16.410 --> 01:08:17.100
Brian Nguyen: My

561
01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:29.130
Brian Nguyen: Investment my deduction from this is that you probably ran to X to pee in this folder. Correct.

562
01:08:31.710 --> 01:08:32.430
Brian Nguyen: Motion. I see.

563
01:08:34.530 --> 01:08:46.560
Brian Nguyen: Less likely right so and so when you ran that you paid X to tea, water, x, y, z, but that file is not in that folder where you are right.

564
01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:56.730
Brian Nguyen: So it doesn't cover anything. Okay. Alright, so that's the, that's the first error. Right. So let's go into your CIO ops water folder.

565
01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:22.950
Brian Nguyen: Little slightly little messy.

566
01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:34.410
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so you have to be on your, your own time couldn't figure out how to reorganize all this based on the way we get it in the car.

567
01:09:35.610 --> 01:09:47.040
Brian Nguyen: So it looks like there's a God water folder within your deal finder folder. Okay, so we should have probably ran our calculation in the Pb folders and let's go in there.

568
01:09:54.960 --> 01:10:00.090
Brian Nguyen: Alright, we should have probably ran a calculation or death to SCP I believe

569
01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:04.140
Brian Nguyen: PD into that folder.

570
01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:10.950
Brian Nguyen: Right.

571
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:34.440
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so yes. So you ran your calculation. Perfect. Right. So what we can do here is temporary optimize the structure in depth to Sep we can just take the coordinate file copy this core file your death to team up. Copy that.

572
01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:37.650
Brian Nguyen: All right, face.

573
01:10:38.670 --> 01:10:51.330
Brian Nguyen: Alright, use the difficult part. Now you are now currently in this works for work folder work three Sergio PB TTP, how can you point this

574
01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:56.010
Brian Nguyen: To the folder test to PvP

575
01:10:57.540 --> 01:11:04.800
Brian Nguyen: And I know I'm open this also up to everyone else, okay for you to give me your best answer what order you put

576
01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:09.720
Theresa Carlos: Sharing that is a

577
01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:12.390
Slash

578
01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:24.900
Brian Nguyen: Educate write it out, type it out. We'll see. We'll see how your the process go through and it will just kind of adjust that. Right, I'm

579
01:11:25.230 --> 01:11:26.610
Theresa Carlos: Not sure. Okay.

580
01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.370
Brian Nguyen: Okay. Is that your final answer.

581
01:11:30.150 --> 01:11:30.540
No.

582
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:40.950
Brian Nguyen: That's okay to make mistakes. So what we want to do here. There's, there's many options to do

583
01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:43.920
Brian Nguyen: To do this, right.

584
01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:49.530
Brian Nguyen: You can do for what you just wrote out or slash

585
01:11:51.150 --> 01:11:52.590
Brian Nguyen: Typing the folder work.

586
01:11:56.190 --> 01:11:56.910
Brian Nguyen: Force back

587
01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.860
Brian Nguyen: To the car live when

588
01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:17.280
Brian Nguyen: You know what were we going to get into right now we're going to the full energy up a good ad. Sure. I think you're missing an underscore

589
01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:26.370
Brian Nguyen: We can get up and walk water. There we go. Make sure to use type it out correctly right TV.

590
01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:31.320
Brian Nguyen: If you

591
01:12:38.670 --> 01:12:40.590
Brian Nguyen: That will meet. So what okay

592
01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:51.390
Brian Nguyen: Don't race it. All right, this is a good teachable moment. All right. So when you type out that to SVP

593
01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.180
Brian Nguyen: So remember, we want to

594
01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:59.460
Brian Nguyen: Copy this file to PvP right

595
01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:04.080
Brian Nguyen: Right, so we def to PvP

596
01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:31.800
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so just keep in mind. So what we just did here. Very seeping a file chord in the because you're right now you're currently in the PDF to SCP correct and now you're going to copy that to this folder DDP okay and you press enter.

597
01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:37.200
Brian Nguyen: All right, if you do

598
01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:39.780
Brian Nguyen: Go back one folder.

599
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:45.030
Brian Nguyen: And you ll space star.

600
01:13:49.260 --> 01:14:00.870
Brian Nguyen: So you'll see there's your core file. Alright. So, assuming that you probably went into this to TCP and defined, but it didn't have the core file. Okay.

601
01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:14.640
Brian Nguyen: So the way to find worth it runs the A runs the program inside their folders, a urine you're currently in. And if you type in a course you they will, it will sue.

602
01:14:16.050 --> 01:14:19.050
Brian Nguyen: Will try to search for that file in that folder. Okay.

603
01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.330
Brian Nguyen: Let's go back to death to SCP

604
01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:31.440
Brian Nguyen: Hey, I want to show you one minute, one more thing.

605
01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:36.270
Brian Nguyen: Sep Sep

606
01:14:48.090 --> 01:14:51.300
Brian Nguyen: Alright, what's not to do CP

607
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:56.070
Brian Nguyen: Can take note of these sites up space cord.

608
01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:04.590
Brian Nguyen: And take advantage of where we're currently in the directory. Alright so space.

609
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:08.640
Brian Nguyen: We do double period.

610
01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:11.340
For

611
01:15:13.290 --> 01:15:13.980
Brian Nguyen: That to

612
01:15:15.810 --> 01:15:16.680
Brian Nguyen: PvP

613
01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:23.220
Brian Nguyen: TCP IP.

614
01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:29.430
Brian Nguyen: We want to copy this file and TCP four slash will call this

615
01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:30.870
Brian Nguyen: Tech.

616
01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:44.430
Brian Nguyen: Tip when it does, it will copy the court file into to this will see what was happening, right. So just remember where you are right now you're in PV death to SCP

617
01:15:45.150 --> 01:15:57.210
Brian Nguyen: And a destination. If you go back one folder today to get into debt to etc etc. And you also renaming the file to call it test. Okay, so this is entering. See what happens.

618
01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:00.630
Brian Nguyen: Let's go back one folders.

619
01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:03.390
Brian Nguyen: And then Ellis space star.

620
01:16:08.670 --> 01:16:16.050
Brian Nguyen: You see that test files in there. Right. Okay. So I hope that it gives you a bit more sense of how does this Sep work. Okay.

621
01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:17.880
Right.

622
01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:19.440
Theresa Carlos: We

623
01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:25.920
Brian Nguyen: All right. Today, then you can now run time in depth TTP through the same thing that

624
01:16:26.490 --> 01:16:29.190
Theresa Carlos: Will show it doesn't show anything

625
01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:35.700
Brian Nguyen: Think about this. Where are you right now.

626
01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:43.110
Brian Nguyen: Go into PvP for it.

627
01:16:50.190 --> 01:16:52.200
Brian Nguyen: All right now to use the VI court.

628
01:16:56.670 --> 01:17:05.820
Brian Nguyen: Alright well right so you gotta keep in mind, where are you in which folder you are in. All right, does that file is that files there in that folder.

629
01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:17.700
Brian Nguyen: Okay, alright. So I think you can then run define your own your own set up the basis that and all that. Right. Okay, quit and you can finish stop sharing this one.

630
01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:32.400
Brian Nguyen: That excel sheet is there for you guys to reference and double check these calculations are very quick, just going to the hardest part is getting you guys acquainted with turbo more. Okay.

631
01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:35.730
Brian Nguyen: All right.

632
01:17:38.010 --> 01:17:41.130
Brian Nguyen: Questions guys question. Next question.

633
01:17:43.290 --> 01:17:45.360
Brian Nguyen: Good time to give a nod or

634
01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:51.480
Brian Nguyen: Good, good, good. Good to see ya. Good. Jeff, are you good

635
01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:57.630
Brian Nguyen: Good. All right. So that concludes our

636
01:17:59.010 --> 01:18:02.040
Brian Nguyen: Conclude that that section. Okay.

637
01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:07.890
Brian Nguyen: How to run geometry optimization and all of that. Okay.

638
01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:14.340
Brian Nguyen: Before I go on to the next topic. Alright guys, are y'all and yo

639
01:18:16.050 --> 01:18:22.680
Brian Nguyen: I have, we have actually one more high school student who was unable to make it to

640
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:29.610
Brian Nguyen: These extra the sessions Monday, Wednesday, Friday because she has a summer class.

641
01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:34.650
Brian Nguyen: From nine to 12 lashing nine to one in the morning.

642
01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:55.230
Brian Nguyen: For her high school or somewhere like that. And so I am doing an extra session tomorrow. And if you guys are interested. Yeah, I'm pretty much going over some of the topics here again this week. And so Saturday nine to 12

643
01:18:56.310 --> 01:19:08.190
Brian Nguyen: Probably nine to 12, I think, or nine to 11 a few hours. If you guys want to tag along. And, you know, help out or contribute, you know, you know, way to learn

644
01:19:09.450 --> 01:19:16.080
Brian Nguyen: That could be great, you know, so I'll send an email out to you guys, there's an invitation. All right.

645
01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:25.470
Brian Nguyen: How's that sound. That'd be an extra session. You guys want to kind of go over some of the materials we went over this week. Okay.

646
01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:29.340
Brian Nguyen: All right. Okay. So,

647
01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:40.350
Brian Nguyen: So that's how you do jianchao nation. The next read quite next thing is how, what can you do with this little chemistry. Can we look at. Okay.

648
01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:46.440
Brian Nguyen: We're if you recall, I sent you guys

649
01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:49.380
Brian Nguyen: A new set of structures.

650
01:19:51.630 --> 01:19:52.710
Brian Nguyen: Which is the correct one.

651
01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:54.270
Brian Nguyen: All right.

652
01:19:57.630 --> 01:20:02.400
Brian Nguyen: Okay in me unzip the files for me.

653
01:20:05.370 --> 01:20:06.690
Brian Nguyen: Move this over.

654
01:20:09.450 --> 01:20:12.030
Brian Nguyen: One second. So as everyone does the files.

655
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:15.600
Brian Nguyen: All right. Good, good, good.

656
01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:20.190
Brian Nguyen: All right. So one of the best ways

657
01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:25.590
Brian Nguyen: Is to have before because I tend to the files. Right.

658
01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:34.530
Brian Nguyen: If you just take those files, you can just kind of run the calculations, go through the same steps that we did.

659
01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:56.220
Brian Nguyen: But I want to kind of show do that sometimes it's useful to visualize the structure where you're where you're working with first. Okay, so I guess for next five minutes or so is this the it's just take a moment and look at the other structures ourselves using our natural alright

660
01:20:57.450 --> 01:21:02.610
Brian Nguyen: So I'm going to show you some of the interesting things that I think we're going to try to answer the question.

661
01:21:03.810 --> 01:21:13.470
Brian Nguyen: Just recall back from Wednesday we're going to try to figure out why is the T shaped

662
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:17.850
Brian Nguyen: T shaped bending dimer.

663
01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:23.880
Brian Nguyen: The ground state or more stable than the stack.

664
01:21:25.050 --> 01:21:31.110
Brian Nguyen: All the cool, right. So I'm going to show that right now on the green, so you guys can see

665
01:21:32.250 --> 01:21:38.160
Brian Nguyen: This the interesting one, there's a few other molecules. You can look at you on your own.

666
01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:47.130
Brian Nguyen: Will take some take some time to take a look at that, too. I want to show you guys that interesting, interesting molecules first so

667
01:21:48.690 --> 01:21:49.140
Brian Nguyen: Do this.

668
01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:53.250
Brian Nguyen: Alright so here is

669
01:21:54.630 --> 01:22:08.370
Brian Nguyen: updated versions of the file download it for you guys for yourself and get it and then take a look at it. Alright, so, but for now I'm going to show you some of the interesting one that I like to show so

670
01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:11.280
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so

671
01:22:12.630 --> 01:22:16.860
Brian Nguyen: I'm going to show. I want to show you these guys start with

672
01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:19.380
Brian Nguyen: Hoping up avocado.

673
01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:26.490
Aakrsh: Oh, real quick.

674
01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:28.290
Brian Nguyen: Yes.

675
01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.180
Aakrsh: I read on Monday, and now it's

676
01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:35.100
Brian Nguyen: It works now.

677
01:22:35.730 --> 01:22:36.330
Aakrsh: Yeah, it worked.

678
01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:38.250
Aakrsh: out perfectly.

679
01:22:39.210 --> 01:22:43.050
Brian Nguyen: I get it. Yeah, it can get email. I was about to ask you about it.

680
01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:46.170
Brian Nguyen: Good, very good.

681
01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:52.020
Brian Nguyen: Just remember avocado is a free program. So there are bugs.

682
01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:59.790
Brian Nguyen: So when you are making molecules, make sure you are constantly saving. Okay, it will crash a lot

683
01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:04.560
Brian Nguyen: You're experienced that yourself. Okay, so now we're going to open up a file.

684
01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:18.810
Brian Nguyen: You see where I'm going to show the interesting molecules right there with this one.

685
01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:23.070
Brian Nguyen: This is the one that is completely stack.

686
01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:25.560
Brian Nguyen: Right. The that

687
01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:31.170
Brian Nguyen: And we said, we said

688
01:23:32.970 --> 01:23:46.680
Brian Nguyen: We said that this molecule is the most stable right and our reasoning is that it has an overlap the most into it makes sense that the introduction to your hobby should be disrupted. Right.

689
01:23:49.410 --> 01:23:52.830
Brian Nguyen: Right, okay. So just kind of recall that, oh,

690
01:23:54.570 --> 01:23:59.100
Brian Nguyen: No. Now we're going to open up this one. It's called Denton stack.

691
01:24:00.690 --> 01:24:09.090
Brian Nguyen: It's basically like this structure but staggered it so opening that right now. Oh no. Open up with a different program.

692
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:18.270
Brian Nguyen: Me open this up with a different program.

693
01:24:19.470 --> 01:24:19.860
Brian Nguyen: gadget.

694
01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:22.500
Brian Nguyen: All right.

695
01:24:23.730 --> 01:24:25.290
Brian Nguyen: Here you

696
01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:29.340
Brian Nguyen: Can see now.

697
01:24:31.530 --> 01:24:33.960
Brian Nguyen: Is to stagger one. All right.

698
01:24:35.190 --> 01:24:36.420
Brian Nguyen: Let me look at it.

699
01:24:37.950 --> 01:24:38.820
Brian Nguyen: You can see

700
01:24:41.730 --> 01:24:55.920
Brian Nguyen: Interesting is not completely on top of each other. And not only that is slightly rotated devoted to the one in the that right. And apparently, yes. This structure is more stable than this structure.

701
01:24:58.530 --> 01:24:59.250
Brian Nguyen: Very interesting.

702
01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:01.560
Brian Nguyen: This just goes to show you

703
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:16.230
Brian Nguyen: Our understanding of dispersion direction is not very, very intuitive, right. And so there's a lot of active research and I'm doing that right now to try to understand that could be very important for a lot of like, you know, drug design.

704
01:25:17.970 --> 01:25:20.790
Brian Nguyen: Possibilities like designed from drugs.

705
01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:29.130
Brian Nguyen: Right to one last structure like to look at is the T shaped Benji. Yeah. So yeah.

706
01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:31.350
Brian Nguyen: All right.

707
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:34.680
Brian Nguyen: Don't say don't

708
01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:38.670
Brian Nguyen: Open

709
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:46.080
Brian Nguyen: This structure here.

710
01:25:47.970 --> 01:25:52.890
Brian Nguyen: It's interesting because like you already have a hydrogen atom.

711
01:25:54.120 --> 01:26:02.250
Brian Nguyen: Criminal click the only one that's in contact with this is bending, you would think that this is will be the weakest in the stable.

712
01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:18.840
Brian Nguyen: But actually it's actually a candidate for being on the ground state for depending diner. Okay, and just, you know, again, so dispersion traction is very weird or we can say non Indians actions very rude. Okay.

713
01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:21.870
Brian Nguyen: Now,

714
01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:24.420
Brian Nguyen: Why is this important

715
01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:28.410
Brian Nguyen: Message mess. Think about biology for a little bit.

716
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:32.070
Brian Nguyen: So our DNA is made of.

717
01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:35.100
Brian Nguyen: Nucleotides correct

718
01:26:36.630 --> 01:26:45.690
Brian Nguyen: You guys remember what nucleotides are there right at GC and t. Right. We looked it up. I mean, Google this

719
01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:47.910
Brian Nguyen: Nucleotides

720
01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:57.390
Brian Nguyen: Picture.

721
01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:05.280
Brian Nguyen: Why do we care and why people were studying descending diamond. Well, you look at the structure itself here.

722
01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:09.600
Brian Nguyen: Is it restructure right

723
01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:16.530
Brian Nguyen: And so DNA. We know that is a double helix.

724
01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:37.290
Brian Nguyen: And that double helix is also interacting. So the idea is to these these Benji needs like rings are interacting with each other to buy in a stalking pair right on it. It's go let's go back to this effect with DNA looks like you guys can see find DNA.

725
01:27:55.980 --> 01:28:02.340
Brian Nguyen: Guys know why do we, why do we care that's always the question, why do we care so

726
01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:07.230
Brian Nguyen: Right, so

727
01:28:08.730 --> 01:28:16.860
Brian Nguyen: In DNA, it has. We know that there are hydrogen bonding between the two these two types. There's also this interaction between

728
01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:22.080
Brian Nguyen: Between the basis. Right.

729
01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:27.690
Brian Nguyen: And you look at it closely, you see that it's a little sick shape.

730
01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:51.240
Brian Nguyen: That this, you know, the rings these rings are interacting in a staggered format. Right. So it says, because the you know understand we understand like to the reasons behind that we're smaller model is probably extrapolate to understand about been a little bit more. Okay.

731
01:28:52.740 --> 01:29:01.290
Brian Nguyen: Alright, sounds pretty cool. Yeah. So it's a undergoing active research down working on right now. All right.

732
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:04.050
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so

733
01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:07.560
Brian Nguyen: Is, uh,

734
01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:12.480
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so guys have questions their questions about that.

735
01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:21.720
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so we'll take a couple minutes, you know, three to five minutes, maybe 1035

736
01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:35.880
Brian Nguyen: Take a look at the structures that are today tree structure it optimizes for you guys. I also double check that these structures are ground state structures. Okay.

737
01:29:37.710 --> 01:29:40.620
Brian Nguyen: To review how what

738
01:29:41.730 --> 01:29:44.280
Brian Nguyen: The question was posed to you guys is

739
01:29:45.810 --> 01:29:46.470
Brian Nguyen: How

740
01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:50.940
Brian Nguyen: How do I know, how did I there by

741
01:29:52.410 --> 01:29:55.680
Brian Nguyen: That structured I optimize. Is that a ground state.

742
01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:04.170
Aakrsh: We waiting

743
01:30:07.710 --> 01:30:19.200
Brian Nguyen: I'm posing a question for you guys. So I optimize I gave you all the structures. And I said, the claim is that said I optimize all the structures. Right.

744
01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:20.970
Brian Nguyen: How

745
01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:34.860
Brian Nguyen: What what what how do we know what way, in what way can we confirm that the structure I optimize is a true quote unquote work on state.

746
01:30:35.670 --> 01:30:41.310
Aakrsh: Didn't you look at the vibration data and then you see the derivative, we don't want to do or below the minimum

747
01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:45.480
Brian Nguyen: Interview. Yes, yes. Exactly. Okay.

748
01:30:46.590 --> 01:31:04.830
Brian Nguyen: So you check your vibrational analysis and double check it. There's no hint of frequency. And that means that you're struck them add this extra information here, you're not at a, at a point. Okay, so what is this data point.

749
01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:10.140
Brian Nguyen: Going to the whiteboard.

750
01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:14.280
Brian Nguyen: We get my mouth. So instead of point

751
01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:22.590
Brian Nguyen: So you remember recall back when we did geometry optimization, you said that on the surface.

752
01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:29.550
Brian Nguyen: And the draw out to go. Alright, so we said

753
01:31:36.210 --> 01:31:36.510
No.

754
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:39.270
Figure

755
01:31:52.230 --> 01:31:56.610
Brian Nguyen: We said that we are trying to look for a well

756
01:31:58.770 --> 01:31:59.190
Brian Nguyen: Right.

757
01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:01.350
Brian Nguyen: Where

758
01:32:02.610 --> 01:32:04.050
Brian Nguyen: This point right here.

759
01:32:05.370 --> 01:32:10.650
Brian Nguyen: This slope is zero. Right. So a cup is as

760
01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:14.850
Brian Nguyen: Energy

761
01:32:17.490 --> 01:32:19.230
Brian Nguyen: And this is your

762
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:22.440
Brian Nguyen: X coordinate right

763
01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:25.740
Brian Nguyen: D. E.

764
01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:33.150
Brian Nguyen: Is a derivative for people have taken calculus. Which one is

765
01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:35.790
Brian Nguyen: Equal

766
01:32:36.990 --> 01:32:37.380
Brian Nguyen: Yeah.

767
01:32:39.210 --> 01:32:48.000
Brian Nguyen: All right for you guys for other people it's just the slope of two points at this point at this point.

768
01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:50.820
Brian Nguyen: The way a definition.

769
01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:55.020
Brian Nguyen: Derivative is

770
01:32:56.850 --> 01:32:57.450
Brian Nguyen: The limit.

771
01:33:00.450 --> 01:33:02.880
Brian Nguyen: He pushes through

772
01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:18.630
Brian Nguyen: This a little bit more information is a precursor to your calculus class or pre calc class. Okay, there's all i i my philosophy is that you guys see early

773
01:33:20.340 --> 01:33:20.790
Brian Nguyen: You know,

774
01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:27.810
Brian Nguyen: It's easier to learn. Okay, so let's say you have a function. Yeah.

775
01:33:37.170 --> 01:33:37.830
My

776
01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:42.540
Brian Nguyen: Okay, Jeffrey, correct me if I'm wrong.

777
01:33:48.030 --> 01:33:50.100
Jeffrey: There's different ways of doing this. So,

778
01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:53.670
Jeffrey: You just put ha

779
01:33:56.220 --> 01:34:03.420
Jeffrey: But the, the way that you show us that they showed it on Wednesday was the midpoint one. So that would be

780
01:34:05.010 --> 01:34:09.330
Jeffrey: F of x plus age minus f of x minus age over to age.

781
01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:10.950
Brian Nguyen: Right.

782
01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:13.140
Jeffrey: Yeah, whichever one of us.

783
01:34:13.650 --> 01:34:15.450
Brian Nguyen: Yeah so. Okay.

784
01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:17.520
Brian Nguyen: So,

785
01:34:18.810 --> 01:34:22.050
Brian Nguyen: Think of this way is like two points right

786
01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:42.390
Brian Nguyen: This is this is essentially the why why why to is why one over to but one okay are you taking two points here. That is the same, but you want to make this point here.

787
01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:55.710
Brian Nguyen: This this mind here that he gray small like the distance between here and here, very small approximate your boat with that point. Okay, there's a precursor to it.

788
01:34:57.030 --> 01:35:08.130
Brian Nguyen: But you guys know. Alright. So I'll stop there. Question. I just, I wrote down the equation. So, let me know. He's not clear.

789
01:35:10.290 --> 01:35:13.860
Brian Nguyen: All right, so. All right, so

790
01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:29.310
Brian Nguyen: But in. Okay. So, this what arrow here is in one deep right one dimension, our structures is the little bit more complicated is usually in 3D. And so what you can have is a point

791
01:35:31.050 --> 01:35:33.150
Brian Nguyen: And I'm not gonna be able to draw this, but

792
01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:38.940
Brian Nguyen: The say is in 3D three dimension. Okay.

793
01:35:41.610 --> 01:35:43.920
Brian Nguyen: I hope you guys can tell right, I guess.

794
01:35:45.330 --> 01:35:46.470
Brian Nguyen: Out our axes.

795
01:35:56.130 --> 01:35:56.940
Z.

796
01:36:02.220 --> 01:36:02.610
Brian Nguyen: So,

797
01:36:04.050 --> 01:36:13.560
Brian Nguyen: To connect to the negative frequency is that if it points into a saddle point here was this is a point where we call a saddle point.

798
01:36:14.580 --> 01:36:21.240
Brian Nguyen: Because in multiple directions basically at this point is zero. And so it will give you a

799
01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:24.270
Brian Nguyen: Desert. We call a saddle point.

800
01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:29.190
Brian Nguyen: It may feel negative

801
01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:31.770
Brian Nguyen: vibrational frequency

802
01:36:35.670 --> 01:36:40.110
Brian Nguyen: Because even though you're in your calculation this derivative is zero right

803
01:36:42.570 --> 01:36:49.620
Brian Nguyen: So then, your, your, your, your, it was your program was say okay that zero percent converted state right

804
01:36:50.670 --> 01:36:54.150
Brian Nguyen: Just the way it was. What will happen. Okay.

805
01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:57.570
Brian Nguyen: 3D

806
01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:06.870
Brian Nguyen: Geometry.

807
01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:09.000
Brian Nguyen: Geometry.

808
01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:15.690
Brian Nguyen: Alright, this is GMT optimized.

809
01:37:19.950 --> 01:37:21.510
Brian Nguyen: One. Okay.

810
01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:29.760
Brian Nguyen: All right, they're just gonna take note. Keep that in mind what, you know, what does that mean by

811
01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:39.390
Brian Nguyen: What was being by a negative vibrational frequency means you have to set a point here in a three dimensional space. Okay.

812
01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:43.380
Brian Nguyen: All right.

813
01:37:46.590 --> 01:37:48.180
Brian Nguyen: Come on up here.

814
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:52.710
Brian Nguyen: Alright, good.

815
01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:58.920
Brian Nguyen: Clear my drawings. Alright so next question.

816
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:06.210
Brian Nguyen: I have for you guys is how, how do we compute

817
01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:08.700
Brian Nguyen: Finding energy

818
01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:15.150
Brian Nguyen: Right and so visual

819
01:38:23.190 --> 01:38:25.500
Brian Nguyen: Visual we have

820
01:38:44.250 --> 01:38:47.910
Brian Nguyen: Alright, and we're interested in finding

821
01:38:55.770 --> 01:38:56.790
Brian Nguyen: Interaction here.

822
01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:01.770
Brian Nguyen: Okay well call this

823
01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:05.580
Brian Nguyen: Law. So Monterey

824
01:39:07.170 --> 01:39:08.250
Brian Nguyen: Will call this

825
01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:10.710
Brian Nguyen: monitor them or be

826
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:19.620
Brian Nguyen: Alright. On Wednesday, how to compute this finding energy or write it out, delta

827
01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:39.570
Brian Nguyen: As you remember your notes.

828
01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:43.260
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, so

829
01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:45.060
Brian Nguyen: It's there.

830
01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:47.970
Brian Nguyen: give you guys a few minutes.

831
01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:54.780
Brian Nguyen: Have an answer, let me know.

832
01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:32.310
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

833
01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:33.780
Brian Nguyen: It's

834
01:40:34.590 --> 01:40:35.430
Something

835
01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:39.330
Theresa Carlos: He saw a movie.

836
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:41.190
Brian Nguyen: All right.

837
01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:45.090
Brian Nguyen: So what other variables mean

838
01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:49.380
Brian Nguyen: Maybe. Yeah. Anyone else like to contribute.

839
01:40:58.350 --> 01:40:58.920
Brian Nguyen: To Korea.

840
01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:01.650
Brian Nguyen: I haven't heard from you yet.

841
01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:26.220
Brian Nguyen: Let's

842
01:41:26.250 --> 01:41:27.030
Aakrsh: Let's see.

843
01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:28.650
Brian Nguyen: The is the energy

844
01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:30.060
Right.

845
01:41:32.610 --> 01:41:33.600
Brian Nguyen: Energy of what

846
01:41:34.710 --> 01:41:35.400
Brian Nguyen: Was it

847
01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:02.190
Brian Nguyen: What

848
01:42:05.370 --> 01:42:05.610
What

849
01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:14.190
Brian Nguyen: Total total energy is it I need energy

850
01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:17.340
Brian Nguyen: Yeah.

851
01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:27.090
Aakrsh: What's the question.

852
01:42:28.710 --> 01:42:29.790
Brian Nguyen: The question is,

853
01:42:31.410 --> 01:42:32.880
Brian Nguyen: We have this formula here.

854
01:42:34.050 --> 01:42:45.060
Brian Nguyen: For binding energy. So, delta is by the energy and Teresa says that to get that on the entity, you do eat up a plus b minus he sells a be

855
01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:48.630
Brian Nguyen: What are these there were standing for

856
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.540
Brian Nguyen: This

857
01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:53.670
Brian Nguyen: He

858
01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:12.060
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, that's basically it. You're right. Yes, I said, yeah. So, these, these sub A is the total energy of Lorimer a key. So be is the total energy alarm or be

859
01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:25.290
Brian Nguyen: An ISA ad is the total energy of this whole complex right so if you take that total energy of these monomers, you subtract out your

860
01:43:26.130 --> 01:43:40.830
Brian Nguyen: Total energy or your complex what's best. So it must mean that over is this finding energy. Okay, yeah, I can see that. Right, very interesting. This is an approximation. There's more to it.

861
01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:43.650
Brian Nguyen: So these guys.

862
01:43:46.050 --> 01:43:48.960
Brian Nguyen: Right. So this is a, this is what we call

863
01:43:51.210 --> 01:43:51.900
Brian Nguyen: Super

864
01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:54.570
Brian Nguyen: Molecular

865
01:43:58.200 --> 01:43:59.010
Brian Nguyen: Calculate

866
01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:08.610
Brian Nguyen: Calculate by new energies.

867
01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:09.840
Brian Nguyen: So,

868
01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:14.940
Brian Nguyen: These

869
01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:20.520
Brian Nguyen: Are like their approach. Okay. And this approach.

870
01:44:23.550 --> 01:44:24.630
Brian Nguyen: Can be dependent

871
01:44:26.730 --> 01:44:29.970
Brian Nguyen: On the method and basis ship.

872
01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:32.250
Brian Nguyen: OK.

873
01:44:34.050 --> 01:44:41.250
Brian Nguyen: So now I'm back in your geography optimization. You saw that there are bond distances reading depend a lot on the basis

874
01:44:42.870 --> 01:44:49.080
Brian Nguyen: But in this case, you will find that it depends on both the message. And then he said, Okay, all right.

875
01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:57.150
Brian Nguyen: We'll save that we're, we're going to try to figure out how to do this. And what we're gonna do is I'm going to take our structures.

876
01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:13.500
Brian Nguyen: And we're gonna compete, the total energy of each of these molecules for energy this water molecule to enter this water molecule and the total and get the whole complex us a bit of math and we'll do it kit or Bindi okay

877
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:15.870
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so let's go

878
01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:20.040
Brian Nguyen: And this year we're going to go back

879
01:45:22.620 --> 01:45:27.510
Brian Nguyen: To our for interns folder and we're going to copy that folder.

880
01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:33.060
Brian Nguyen: To our workstation a modeling facility. Okay.

881
01:45:34.770 --> 01:45:36.150
Brian Nguyen: All right, so

882
01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:40.920
Brian Nguyen: Go back.

883
01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:49.350
Brian Nguyen: Here, their desktop is my terminal. Again, you're all my

884
01:45:50.490 --> 01:45:57.090
Brian Nguyen: Complex. Alright, so I want to copy all these competencies to my

885
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:07.560
Brian Nguyen: My work folder on my Molly facility account right. Everyone knows that we've been typing STP.

886
01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:13.320
Brian Nguyen: Right. And what is the option for copying folders.

887
01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:16.290
Brian Nguyen: Shout out to me.

888
01:46:19.230 --> 01:46:20.130
Victoria Choi: Yes, good, good.

889
01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:20.520
Brian Nguyen: Korea.

890
01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:21.630
Dash are

891
01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:29.160
Brian Nguyen: And we want to send this case, you want the file and the file we want is this one for insurance.

892
01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:36.120
Brian Nguyen: Right, so for you guys is go to the folder where you have this file you download this file you unzip it

893
01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:40.020
Brian Nguyen: And then we're going to go to copy this to our

894
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:43.170
Brian Nguyen: Work directory

895
01:46:46.260 --> 01:46:46.830
Brian Nguyen: All right.

896
01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:55.140
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

897
01:46:56.550 --> 01:47:00.000
Brian Nguyen: Just make sure you copy this to the same computer. All right.

898
01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:08.160
Brian Nguyen: I just want to pause a little bit and ask you guys guys have questions.

899
01:47:10.260 --> 01:47:15.060
Theresa Carlos: And they can just sense of mine through my folders on my computer because

900
01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:16.230
My son again.

901
01:47:17.310 --> 01:47:24.030
Brian Nguyen: Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, so definitely a bit unrealistic. The same way we did it on Wednesday.

902
01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:27.270
Brian Nguyen: And then copy it to some folders.

903
01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:38.880
Brian Nguyen: And go to that folder in an FTP file or directory. Okay. All right. So I for a diet but cool. Do it. Same thing. I'll do mine.

904
01:47:46.110 --> 01:47:49.920
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so now let's say to that computer

905
01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:52.110
Brian Nguyen: Your computer

906
01:48:10.890 --> 01:48:11.940
Brian Nguyen: My home directory

907
01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:24.210
Brian Nguyen: Closely, here is my file for Internet. Alright.

908
01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:28.440
Brian Nguyen: So now what you should do.

909
01:48:29.670 --> 01:48:36.720
Brian Nguyen: Is. Well, one way of organizing this is Miss make a folder called non code valid.

910
01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:38.670
Brian Nguyen: All right.

911
01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:47.130
Brian Nguyen: But I already have my folder. Okay.

912
01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:54.720
Brian Nguyen: But for now, I'm going to name it an uncle van to is this is the alias. Okay, we're just gonna

913
01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:05.160
Brian Nguyen: Name it whatever file you want, right. So what we're gonna do is we're going to move this file to this folder.

914
01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:10.080
Brian Nguyen: The envy is very similar to copy

915
01:49:12.150 --> 01:49:12.510
Brian Nguyen: Parents

916
01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:14.190
Brian Nguyen: Do

917
01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:22.890
Brian Nguyen: Not

918
01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:27.510
Brian Nguyen: Stop here.

919
01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:32.790
Brian Nguyen: Right questions.

920
01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:39.600
Brian Nguyen: To me and Chris con the car, you got up in the trees are catching up. Right.

921
01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:42.360
Brian Nguyen: Now, okay.

922
01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:49.050
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so this is of utmost importance.

923
01:49:50.700 --> 01:49:54.360
Brian Nguyen: All right, is to keep your directory organized

924
01:49:55.860 --> 01:49:56.250
Brian Nguyen: All right.

925
01:49:57.660 --> 01:49:58.620
Brian Nguyen: Alex star.

926
01:49:59.940 --> 01:50:04.080
Brian Nguyen: We see them have a bunch of molecules here.

927
01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:07.650
Brian Nguyen: So for every single

928
01:50:09.630 --> 01:50:10.350
Brian Nguyen: Molecule.

929
01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:20.070
Brian Nguyen: into town disappear. Okay. All right. So for every single molecule.

930
01:50:22.110 --> 01:50:28.650
Brian Nguyen: You want to run this calculation separately in each folder. Okay.

931
01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:31.530
Brian Nguyen: All right, so

932
01:50:35.220 --> 01:50:38.820
Brian Nguyen: So we can make folders make directory

933
01:50:41.970 --> 01:50:48.000
Brian Nguyen: And we're going to name it correspond to each of the XYZ file right benzene.

934
01:50:49.260 --> 01:50:51.570
Brian Nguyen: In the same lack, you can make multiple files.

935
01:50:53.130 --> 01:50:54.240
Brian Nguyen: NZ dime.

936
01:50:57.330 --> 01:50:59.280
Brian Nguyen: Then the stairs.

937
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:05.220
Brian Nguyen: That came

938
01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:09.120
Brian Nguyen: That came underscored in

939
01:51:16.110 --> 01:51:17.640
Brian Nguyen: Shape and

940
01:51:19.710 --> 01:51:20.340
Brian Nguyen: Water

941
01:51:21.810 --> 01:51:22.800
Brian Nguyen: And water.

942
01:51:31.140 --> 01:51:34.890
Brian Nguyen: Very important. Make sure that you run all your calculation.

943
01:51:36.990 --> 01:51:39.300
Brian Nguyen: In separate folders. All right.

944
01:51:40.470 --> 01:51:42.270
Brian Nguyen: Okay. Yes, question.

945
01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:47.910
Brian Nguyen: Oh, yes, yes.

946
01:51:49.890 --> 01:51:56.010
Brian Nguyen: Yes. All right. Once you get once you get open your folder here is

947
01:51:57.810 --> 01:51:59.640
Brian Nguyen: Sep my here.

948
01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:13.290
Brian Nguyen: Ash are nine dash ours important for directories for interns username, the computer colon and then you just specify the destination.

949
01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:28.500
Theresa Carlos: Usage Sep

950
01:52:30.210 --> 01:52:32.070
Brian Nguyen: Sep our are

951
01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:36.210
Brian Nguyen: The file name.

952
01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:40.680
Brian Nguyen: And then your username and then the IP address.

953
01:52:43.050 --> 01:52:47.220
Brian Nguyen: And then it's separated by colon. It gives you the destination.

954
01:52:59.760 --> 01:52:59.970
Brian Nguyen: It.

955
01:53:01.050 --> 01:53:03.690
Brian Nguyen: Takes a few times to understand what's happening.

956
01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:06.600
Brian Nguyen: And keep thinking about it. All right.

957
01:53:08.730 --> 01:53:09.540
Brian Nguyen: Alright, yeah.

958
01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:10.590
Brian Nguyen: Yeah.

959
01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:14.790
Aakrsh: Can you repeat that. From where do you created all these directories and when you do

960
01:53:19.170 --> 01:53:22.980
Brian Nguyen: That once you get that we create a non caffeinated folder.

961
01:53:24.150 --> 01:53:28.650
Brian Nguyen: And then we move the intern file into that.

962
01:53:29.190 --> 01:53:29.850
Aakrsh: Folder. Yeah.

963
01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:34.800
Aakrsh: Again, I can only drink music anything benzene and

964
01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:43.830
Brian Nguyen: So the next step is to copy all the files into their respective directory

965
01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:46.290
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

966
01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:55.860
Brian Nguyen: So you can do two options. Either you do CP blah blah blah file wherever the file path is

967
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:58.500
Brian Nguyen: And then you say,

968
01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:02.580
Brian Nguyen: File the destination right and

969
01:54:04.380 --> 01:54:07.410
Brian Nguyen: And you did it one by one for every single

970
01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:09.630
Brian Nguyen: Folder.

971
01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:18.240
Brian Nguyen: More you can take advantage that I named each of the folders, according to

972
01:54:20.190 --> 01:54:21.810
Brian Nguyen: The naming of the XYZ

973
01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:29.520
Brian Nguyen: Files. Right. So our set it up for you guys. You can write a little script.

974
01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:34.320
Brian Nguyen: That can copy the files into each of the folders.

975
01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:38.850
Brian Nguyen: Right. So you see, you see how I name all of them according to the

976
01:54:39.870 --> 01:54:40.320
Brian Nguyen: You guys

977
01:54:41.370 --> 01:54:41.610
Brian Nguyen: Right.

978
01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:53.430
Brian Nguyen: So we can take advantage of that and and I'll give you the bare bones of how to do that. Okay. You can write a little script no practice for you guys. Right. And so remember that for loop.

979
01:54:54.330 --> 01:55:04.110
Brian Nguyen: Color can be very useful right here. Everything do. The first step is to determine where, where is your bash command.

980
01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:10.800
Brian Nguyen: Right here is copy that and I'm gonna write a script call

981
01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:14.760
Brian Nguyen: Copy file.

982
01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:20.760
Brian Nguyen: Da SH SH is the extension for the dash command. All right.

983
01:55:26.550 --> 01:55:36.330
Brian Nguyen: Oh yeah, so just loading up taking a while. It's okay. So just keep in mind this is always good practice right if you can figure out a way to the script that could be very useful.

984
01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:44.640
Brian Nguyen: And you can kind of generalize it in the future, you know that that kind of idea right but this is good, a good practices in it. Good to know.

985
01:55:46.260 --> 01:55:51.690
Brian Nguyen: So we do this, this number. This shipping and and we add this

986
01:55:52.740 --> 01:56:07.680
Brian Nguyen: Past suit a bash command. Alright, so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say I'm going to for whatever variable. I want to use, say the name of the file.

987
01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:09.210
Brian Nguyen: In

988
01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:15.360
Brian Nguyen: And then I'm going to do is I'm going to save this.

989
01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:18.120
Brian Nguyen: Okay, thank you.

990
01:56:19.650 --> 01:56:22.440
Brian Nguyen: And I'm gonna have to essentially copy

991
01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:29.580
Brian Nguyen: All these guys, if I can copy it. Nice, easy. I don't know about on Windows.

992
01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:31.380
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

993
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:40.500
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so there's a weird spaces. So I'll try to meet that

994
01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:23.400
Brian Nguyen: This is a long

995
01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:27.150
Brian Nguyen: I forgot. I forgot how to

996
01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:43.200
Brian Nguyen: So this is basically a run on sentence or an online coding mind. Typically, you want to keep it, you know, a certain distance and certain number of characters and then break the line I forgot to do this.

997
01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:48.570
Brian Nguyen: But for now, we'll just write it all in one line. Alright.

998
01:57:48.990 --> 01:57:49.980
So far, so good.

999
01:57:51.450 --> 01:57:51.750
Brian Nguyen: Yes.

1000
01:57:53.850 --> 01:57:58.380
Jeffrey: Can interesting this is for Windows users, how to enable

1001
01:57:59.190 --> 01:58:01.350
Brian Nguyen: The right me stop.

1002
01:58:06.930 --> 01:58:09.720
Jeffrey: Right, so everyone on Windows, can you

1003
01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:12.690
Jeffrey: Read books on semolina

1004
01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:26.400
Jeffrey: So at the top where you like drag around this window right click and you'll see your options. So if you go to properties will click on that.

1005
01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:31.320
Jeffrey: You'll see a new window pop up.

1006
01:58:32.730 --> 01:58:39.390
Jeffrey: And on their options. You'll see under edit options there is control shift, see who he is copy paste

1007
01:58:40.020 --> 01:58:42.750
Brian Nguyen: So now I'm a big African you

1008
01:58:42.990 --> 01:58:45.780
Brian Nguyen: Okay. Your whole desktop on today.

1009
01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:56.400
Jeffrey: So I have this right click

1010
01:58:58.260 --> 01:58:59.130
Jeffrey: Go to properties.

1011
01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:05.130
Jeffrey: And another properties will see this

1012
01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:09.630
Jeffrey: An actual insulin, Control Shift CBS copy paste

1013
01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:11.640
Jeffrey: So you can just tell that on

1014
01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:17.130
That should be

1015
01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:19.350
Jeffrey: C.

1016
01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:21.870
Control V

1017
01:59:28.500 --> 01:59:29.610
Jeffrey: So here's a little spin

1018
01:59:32.250 --> 01:59:33.690
Brian Nguyen: It's good. Very good. Thank you.

1019
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:35.430
Jeffrey: Oh, good. Yeah.

1020
01:59:35.550 --> 01:59:39.420
Brian Nguyen: And, you know, would be helpful for Teresa and Victoria.

1021
01:59:40.710 --> 01:59:41.190
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1022
01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:42.600
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1023
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:46.980
Brian Nguyen: We can practice reading the script.

1024
01:59:49.170 --> 01:59:54.120
Brian Nguyen: This is probably on your own time and work on it. Alright, so what I would do.

1025
01:59:59.340 --> 02:00:06.390
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so, for I for name in this list of names as I'm going to do.

1026
02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:12.660
Brian Nguyen: And depending on where I run this calculation on what to say. I'm going to copy

1027
02:00:14.580 --> 02:00:17.310
Brian Nguyen: Right, I know exactly where my file is

1028
02:00:18.810 --> 02:00:19.320
Brian Nguyen: Or

1029
02:00:21.210 --> 02:00:21.810
Brian Nguyen: Interns

1030
02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:24.630
Brian Nguyen: Or slash

1031
02:00:25.890 --> 02:00:37.050
Brian Nguyen: And then imma uses dollar signs name. Now, keep in mind that coding. There's many more. There's more than one answer right. This is just one way I can think of right

1032
02:00:38.250 --> 02:00:45.390
Brian Nguyen: I know that each of the file extension those files is XYZ right

1033
02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:49.200
Brian Nguyen: That copy that to me.

1034
02:00:52.770 --> 02:00:54.090
Is done

1035
02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:00.750
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, okay.

1036
02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:03.330
Aakrsh: Oh, Mr Brian

1037
02:01:04.170 --> 02:01:06.840
Aakrsh: Yet so you bi.

1038
02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:09.690
Aakrsh: non trivial for this.

1039
02:01:11.190 --> 02:01:17.340
Brian Nguyen: No TV VI, the whole directory. So what you do. You've probably had to directory

1040
02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:20.340
Brian Nguyen: All right into the directory

1041
02:01:21.990 --> 02:01:35.970
Brian Nguyen: So you see this extra things so quit out there. So what I did was, there's two way. I think what what a what a Jeffrey showed you guys was to use touch to create the file.

1042
02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:52.410
Brian Nguyen: Right, I put the extension here. Okay. And then he says that once you create the file you can do VI, whatever the file name to create it. Okay.

1043
02:01:54.060 --> 02:02:11.670
Brian Nguyen: What I'm showing you is a different way. Sorry, so there's there's many ways it's remember there's many ways of doing this. So once you're into for non event, you can just type in CI and you can basically a file and call it whatever file is I just call it a copy. Sh.

1044
02:02:12.930 --> 02:02:15.480
Brian Nguyen: You okay, you will create that file or you

1045
02:02:16.530 --> 02:02:21.540
Brian Nguyen: Hey, we'll save that file. Once you save it. When you use W. Right.

1046
02:02:23.220 --> 02:02:32.520
Brian Nguyen: Yeah. Alright, so most important is Germany. This one is needed if you want to run this virtual is important if you needed to run

1047
02:02:35.370 --> 02:02:37.380
Brian Nguyen: an executable file. Okay.

1048
02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:41.010
Brian Nguyen: Here is this is my little script for you guys.

1049
02:02:42.300 --> 02:02:42.810
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1050
02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:45.810
Brian Nguyen: And I should quit.

1051
02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:49.920
Brian Nguyen: At LS dash l

1052
02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:57.150
Brian Nguyen: You notice that this thing is not an executable file right here. There's no

1053
02:02:58.410 --> 02:03:03.480
Brian Nguyen: Not executable. What we're going to retain that PCH mall.

1054
02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:12.210
Brian Nguyen: And we'll see that now it's a script.

1055
02:03:13.890 --> 02:03:17.100
Brian Nguyen: Execute execute that script your new copy

1056
02:03:21.570 --> 02:03:26.340
Brian Nguyen: Okay, do I copy the file I do Ellis star.

1057
02:03:29.070 --> 02:03:33.240
Brian Nguyen: See that it's all there, la, la.

1058
02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:40.860
Brian Nguyen: So it's very useful if you have all your ex like the file name.

1059
02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:46.140
Brian Nguyen: And then create a folder that quarterly to this evenings. Okay.

1060
02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:53.760
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so I went real fast there guys have questions, we just went over.

1061
02:03:58.260 --> 02:04:10.620
Brian Nguyen: This is just to make your life a little bit easier sometimes he wanted a little for loop where it can run this very quickly. Okay, I can do it one by one. All right.

1062
02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:13.080
Aakrsh: Wait.

1063
02:04:13.170 --> 02:04:16.830
Aakrsh: One second. So I mean a net routing.

1064
02:04:18.390 --> 02:04:18.840
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1065
02:04:23.370 --> 02:04:24.510
Brian Nguyen: I'm a slow down here.

1066
02:04:25.590 --> 02:04:27.540
Brian Nguyen: After three cities caught up.

1067
02:04:28.410 --> 02:04:37.200
Theresa Carlos: Yet so when I was doing the ICP saying that my smile does not exist, even though I found the file and it shows that I have

1068
02:04:39.930 --> 02:04:44.400
Brian Nguyen: Okay. All right. Hold that thought. Hold that question. Is it

1069
02:04:45.540 --> 02:04:47.580
Brian Nguyen: Next, Victoria and time.

1070
02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:50.130
Brian Nguyen: To go going

1071
02:04:52.110 --> 02:04:52.800
Victoria Choi: Oh, good.

1072
02:04:54.090 --> 02:04:56.070
Brian Nguyen: Wow, very impressive again.

1073
02:04:57.180 --> 02:05:14.760
Brian Nguyen: Keep it up. All right, I my name, I might need your help. Victorian times already. A couple shoot some of the things. All right. So, all right, 30 so I would like to share your screen and con in Victoria helped me out. What's the air.

1074
02:05:17.850 --> 02:05:18.540
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1075
02:05:30.030 --> 02:05:39.390
Brian Nguyen: So let's go to the most recent one at the bottom right side, it shows you were speaking to man. Alright, so you've already unzip the file. Correct.

1076
02:05:40.740 --> 02:05:46.350
Brian Nguyen: And okay, you create the file you put it in here. Correct. All right. We see this

1077
02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:50.730
Brian Nguyen: Okay. So we see this air right

1078
02:05:52.410 --> 02:05:57.870
Brian Nguyen: Town and Victoria who do like to answer why what happened here.

1079
02:06:21.930 --> 02:06:22.530
Brian Nguyen: Went wrong.

1080
02:06:23.070 --> 02:06:24.330
Theresa Carlos: Missing here.

1081
02:06:25.650 --> 02:06:36.420
Victoria Choi: Oh, I'm so cuz she's in the for interns file. So there's no for interns file inside the for insurance directory so she has to do CP

1082
02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:40.920
Victoria Choi: She has to go back a directory and then do it. Yeah.

1083
02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:42.660
Victoria Choi: Alright, so

1084
02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:43.860
Brian Nguyen: Before we do that,

1085
02:06:45.300 --> 02:06:48.720
Brian Nguyen: Oh, go back to the intern ed for intern.

1086
02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:53.130
Brian Nguyen: Here.

1087
02:06:56.250 --> 02:07:16.020
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so, yeah. So remember when you just did it in the SEP the freebie Sep command. They're copying that for interns file right but you're you're in that for interns file right okay so good. Alright, so now that's that's correct that callback CD to put try doing that again.

1088
02:07:33.780 --> 02:07:34.230
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1089
02:07:35.790 --> 02:07:37.770
Brian Nguyen: To that folder file in computer

1090
02:07:50.220 --> 02:08:04.740
Brian Nguyen: Just keep in mind that it's okay to make mistakes, you know, very common. I've made these mistakes before in the past and I probably still make these mistakes sometimes when I get really tired. They were really late in the night. Right, so

1091
02:08:06.030 --> 02:08:08.880
Brian Nguyen: It's just want to say that it's okay to make mistakes. Okay.

1092
02:08:12.150 --> 02:08:12.810
Brian Nguyen: Alright, what's next.

1093
02:08:23.820 --> 02:08:26.490
Brian Nguyen: So remember where we go up a little bit.

1094
02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:38.100
Brian Nguyen: More alright so we copy that file into our work directory. Okay, go to that work directory. Right.

1095
02:08:49.710 --> 02:08:50.220
Alright.

1096
02:08:59.940 --> 02:09:04.500
Brian Nguyen: Alright, we're going to make one more folder. Make a directory called non convenience.

1097
02:09:05.610 --> 02:09:15.900
Brian Nguyen: So this is, this is very important and make sure that you're organizing all your calculation. Right. Okay, now let's move to the command envy is move

1098
02:09:17.130 --> 02:09:24.090
Brian Nguyen: A very similar to copy. So instead of copying it just moves too fast for you. It will type in for interns.

1099
02:09:25.140 --> 02:09:27.750
Brian Nguyen: And move that for interns into the non credit folders.

1100
02:09:35.070 --> 02:09:50.790
Brian Nguyen: Now only for that so that that force back is really unique for like my folders, our export within the system. Okay, so in case you don't need that type noncombatant because you already are in this folder for Carlos. Okay.

1101
02:09:52.050 --> 02:09:52.170
And

1102
02:09:54.450 --> 02:09:54.840
Brian Nguyen: Ellis.

1103
02:09:58.410 --> 02:10:04.020
Brian Nguyen: And now you see that the foreign currencies in your non event order right and it's going to non prevent order.

1104
02:10:12.870 --> 02:10:15.330
Brian Nguyen: All right, you ll star.

1105
02:10:18.180 --> 02:10:19.050
Brian Nguyen: Let's say star.

1106
02:10:20.970 --> 02:10:34.410
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so now you see that you have all those x, y, z coordinates. Right. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna make a directory name everything based on the molecules NATO summit MK dir

1107
02:10:37.650 --> 02:10:46.200
Brian Nguyen: Based and then Benji face and D underscore been days and do it for every single one.

1108
02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:50.520
Brian Nguyen: noni noni for XYZ

1109
02:10:57.030 --> 02:11:02.670
Brian Nguyen: Here we go, nd instead that came up there for each one.

1110
02:11:03.690 --> 02:11:04.410
Brian Nguyen: And then

1111
02:11:06.570 --> 02:11:15.570
Brian Nguyen: As you're doing that. Keep in mind that each of those structures you want to run your calculations separately and each folder. Okay.

1112
02:11:16.710 --> 02:11:18.750
Brian Nguyen: You guys mind like you guys know

1113
02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:27.990
Brian Nguyen: Right and do LS

1114
02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:35.160
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1115
02:11:36.750 --> 02:11:46.260
Brian Nguyen: So we okay so you have two options. Oh, you want to copy each of those equity files and folders.

1116
02:11:47.700 --> 02:11:53.730
Brian Nguyen: That we send you guys the chat my script.

1117
02:12:02.190 --> 02:12:04.200
Brian Nguyen: So sorry. So you can well

1118
02:12:05.250 --> 02:12:11.430
Brian Nguyen: You got two options here you copy each of those folders so you do see Peters IPP

1119
02:12:14.790 --> 02:12:18.120
Brian Nguyen: Or slash FTP and forth for interns.

1120
02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:24.870
Brian Nguyen: No no no no SVP test for interns.

1121
02:12:27.510 --> 02:12:32.610
Brian Nguyen: They recovered yet for underscore intern and force is

1122
02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:36.540
Brian Nguyen: No space.

1123
02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:41.880
Brian Nguyen: Right, tap, tap, tap.

1124
02:12:43.710 --> 02:12:44.430
Brian Nguyen: Into folder.

1125
02:12:46.740 --> 02:12:50.130
Brian Nguyen: All right, we're gonna take one of these files. I wonder files in for me.

1126
02:12:58.860 --> 02:13:01.650
Brian Nguyen: Know the whole file names up

1127
02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:03.510
Brian Nguyen: The up arrow.

1128
02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:09.600
Brian Nguyen: The whole file name in that folder XYZ

1129
02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:12.840
Brian Nguyen: Space, we're going to

1130
02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:27.060
Brian Nguyen: The careful, don't, don't start pressing enter yet, right, so remember copy. Start with the file and then the destination right space.

1131
02:13:28.230 --> 02:13:31.500
Brian Nguyen: So now keep in mind, you're into non event folder. Right.

1132
02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:40.410
Brian Nguyen: We don't want to copy it into non cabana folders you want to copy it inside whatever it corresponded for me so bending underscore days.

1133
02:13:56.220 --> 02:13:57.960
Brian Nguyen: Ellis Ellis a star.

1134
02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:07.410
Brian Nguyen: Now you see that in there at the end is Gordon likes it.

1135
02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:11.490
Brian Nguyen: And I'll repeat it for the rest of the folders. All right.

1136
02:14:13.470 --> 02:14:20.940
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, so I was showing earlier that if you do that step by step you take some time, but, you know, it might be a little bit faster.

1137
02:14:22.470 --> 02:14:30.510
Brian Nguyen: Is to write a script that does it all for you. Alright, so for you when I think it may be much more beneficial to kind of practice.

1138
02:14:31.170 --> 02:14:44.970
Brian Nguyen: All right before using the for loop right I'll share that script you guys in the email. Alright, so you guys can see it. All right, that I can you stop sharing start moving on to our next step.

1139
02:14:46.590 --> 02:14:48.090
Brian Nguyen: All right, good.

1140
02:14:49.950 --> 02:14:52.110
Brian Nguyen: Chris, you got you caught up. Yeah.

1141
02:14:53.100 --> 02:14:53.340
It.

1142
02:14:54.390 --> 02:15:00.600
Brian Nguyen: All right, now we're going to do the same thing that we did on Monday. I mean, sorry. Wednesday.

1143
02:15:02.190 --> 02:15:09.540
Brian Nguyen: Pick your favorite molecule takes benzene, so it's easy for me to kind of go in order

1144
02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:28.200
Brian Nguyen: And we're going to go to the same steps that we did on Wednesday. Right. So we got to double check that we have loaded our program. So do module this and what you should have is that it should show a turbo program here.

1145
02:15:30.030 --> 02:15:45.660
Brian Nguyen: And it shows that, then you're all set and let's get started preparing our calculation. Right. So we call we have just started. We're just giving an x, y, z coordinate. So just the position of our Adam

1146
02:15:46.890 --> 02:15:53.580
Brian Nguyen: Right, so we need to convert this format, which is kind of remind ourselves what's the format of xyz.

1147
02:15:56.670 --> 02:15:57.480
Brian Nguyen: It looks like this.

1148
02:15:58.560 --> 02:15:59.070
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1149
02:16:00.930 --> 02:16:05.400
Brian Nguyen: Thank you mind. So this is all in Engstrom okay the username.

1150
02:16:08.130 --> 02:16:12.630
Brian Nguyen: What's the command to convert an x, y, z file into trouble. More format.

1151
02:16:14.460 --> 02:16:18.630
Aakrsh: To tea and then the file name and then greater than

1152
02:16:19.590 --> 02:16:20.580
Greater than a really

1153
02:16:22.110 --> 02:16:22.710
Aakrsh: Cool.

1154
02:16:24.570 --> 02:16:33.120
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so remember that this that greater than symbol of course they say outputs the file into a name right into a file. Okay.

1155
02:16:33.300 --> 02:16:34.080
Aakrsh: We Mr Brian

1156
02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:37.830
Aakrsh: Yes. Why did you VI Benji.

1157
02:16:39.210 --> 02:16:47.970
Brian Nguyen: I VI into the benzene XYZ so that you guys are familiar with. What's the format of excellence nice file.

1158
02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:58.080
Brian Nguyen: Okay, fine. When you were working on all of these things. And like we don't, we're not, you know, we don't pay attention to the formatting.

1159
02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:11.400
Brian Nguyen: Right. But it's useful in the future of you, you have to troubleshoot something you understand what the you know what what really is the inverse of all these things right. The details of it right

1160
02:17:12.990 --> 02:17:20.280
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so now we're going to look at the VI cord to make sure that our file output out the corner.

1161
02:17:21.210 --> 02:17:29.520
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so I know I noticed that you guys. Sometimes you guys didn't check so wanting double check that your output is correct. Okay.

1162
02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:45.990
Brian Nguyen: It looks like it's all there. Right. The numbers are slightly different, because it's in a comic unit. Okay. You might remember there's slightly different formatting. So they had this dollar sign court and this dollar sign in. Okay, so

1163
02:17:48.750 --> 02:17:49.290
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1164
02:17:50.850 --> 02:17:53.490
Brian Nguyen: Are we done here. You start running our calculation.

1165
02:17:58.500 --> 02:18:00.060
Brian Nguyen: Give me a yes or no.

1166
02:18:05.640 --> 02:18:07.710
Brian Nguyen: Are we done here. You think

1167
02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:10.800
Brian Nguyen: That we can start running our calculation.

1168
02:18:12.330 --> 02:18:22.680
Brian Nguyen: So you start ready job x dash. All right. Okay, I'm gonna start reading this. Don't, no one else type this do not type anything. Do not enter. All right, I'm going to type this in.

1169
02:18:25.530 --> 02:18:29.430
Brian Nguyen: OK. LAUGHING So now you get an error. Right.

1170
02:18:31.590 --> 02:18:44.310
Brian Nguyen: Well, yeah, a bunch of each file, it generates right the one, the very first thing is you you theory kind of read the errors, one by one server more input file control not sound or empty.

1171
02:18:45.420 --> 02:18:52.500
Brian Nguyen: But you found a coordinate file, of course. So it's continually he ran some calculations in a crash.

1172
02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:55.830
Brian Nguyen: Right. So what happened.

1173
02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:02.100
Brian Nguyen: Is that you just have to coordinate file, right, is it the position you're adding

1174
02:19:03.420 --> 02:19:09.330
Brian Nguyen: Right, so remember way back when I asked me Wednesday, how can you get the energy

1175
02:19:10.740 --> 02:19:12.450
Brian Nguyen: Compete energy just from

1176
02:19:13.830 --> 02:19:14.190
You know,

1177
02:19:15.690 --> 02:19:17.580
Brian Nguyen: What, why are you competing right

1178
02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:22.830
Brian Nguyen: And so each of these core file contains or Adam

1179
02:19:24.030 --> 02:19:28.230
Brian Nguyen: Adams are made up of electrons, protons and neutrons. Right.

1180
02:19:29.250 --> 02:19:37.830
Brian Nguyen: And we're interested in the interaction of electrons. And so need to generate molecular orbital.

1181
02:19:39.900 --> 02:19:40.320
Brian Nguyen: Right.

1182
02:19:42.150 --> 02:19:53.010
Brian Nguyen: Okay. And we did not do that, right, so before running your calculations job SSRI. You have to run define

1183
02:19:54.420 --> 02:19:58.500
Brian Nguyen: Okay. So define threat to your calculation.

1184
02:20:00.060 --> 02:20:01.140
Brian Nguyen: Like generating

1185
02:20:02.430 --> 02:20:05.340
Brian Nguyen: Initial molecular orbital.

1186
02:20:09.600 --> 02:20:10.110
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1187
02:20:12.270 --> 02:20:18.330
Brian Nguyen: Does that make make sense. Right. Okay. So we're going to go through this that's been defined

1188
02:20:20.370 --> 02:20:23.670
Brian Nguyen: What I'm gonna do is I'm going to remove all these extra file. We don't need

1189
02:20:27.150 --> 02:20:27.540
Brian Nguyen: So,

1190
02:20:29.220 --> 02:20:41.280
Brian Nguyen: Ali Ali constantly reminding you over and over again about all these commands and what they do and what kind of the purpose they serve. Okay. So, keep going, keep that keep that in your mind. And during that in your

1191
02:20:42.480 --> 02:20:42.780
You know,

1192
02:20:44.940 --> 02:20:56.970
Brian Nguyen: For yourself so that you can know what's what's really happening. Each step. Okay, so let's run define and as I go over these things called kind of give you a little bit more information. Each time we use it. Okay.

1193
02:20:58.140 --> 02:21:14.040
Brian Nguyen: All right, so here's the thing first window say another control type. That's okay. Skip that title is you want put a title know you know bending whatever title you want, it's okay. You don't need a title Treasury a second. Use your calculations.

1194
02:21:15.180 --> 02:21:19.170
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so now here we are in the molecular geometry section.

1195
02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:22.260
Brian Nguyen: What's the first step that we need to do.

1196
02:21:24.930 --> 02:21:26.220
Aakrsh: A course.

1197
02:21:27.750 --> 02:21:40.800
Brian Nguyen: Yes, a court. So keep in mind that there's a bunch of options here. All right. And you input is your Adams. I know. So what you do is this, this folder here is this option here.

1198
02:21:42.180 --> 02:21:44.010
Brian Nguyen: A chord.

1199
02:21:45.240 --> 02:21:47.940
Brian Nguyen: Now keep in mind is cord.

1200
02:21:49.050 --> 02:21:51.570
Brian Nguyen: But her mom was reading, how much grew up with a bit

1201
02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:55.380
Brian Nguyen: Of using this directory here.

1202
02:21:57.330 --> 02:22:05.160
Brian Nguyen: To find your file name court if you don't have that file, are you reading a correctly, it will spit out to the file not sound.

1203
02:22:06.420 --> 02:22:06.840
Okay.

1204
02:22:09.210 --> 02:22:09.600
Brian Nguyen: Enter.

1205
02:22:11.910 --> 02:22:15.840
Brian Nguyen: And then we're going to use this cemetery here.

1206
02:22:17.790 --> 02:22:18.240
Brian Nguyen: As he

1207
02:22:20.070 --> 02:22:25.320
Brian Nguyen: Right, if you're smaller class cemetery, it can really help to speed up your calculation.

1208
02:22:27.990 --> 02:22:29.040
Aakrsh: We just type in daddy.

1209
02:22:30.900 --> 02:22:31.230
Brian Nguyen: Daddy.

1210
02:22:33.150 --> 02:22:36.810
Brian Nguyen: As a default value for you. Okay, right here.

1211
02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:40.230
Brian Nguyen: Desi

1212
02:22:43.140 --> 02:22:43.890
Brian Nguyen: Ooh.

1213
02:22:50.940 --> 02:22:51.240
Brian Nguyen: Yeah.

1214
02:22:52.650 --> 02:22:56.880
Brian Nguyen: Okay then. Yeah, typing. I read

1215
02:22:59.460 --> 02:23:00.900
Brian Nguyen: Just changing the coordinate system.

1216
02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:07.410
Brian Nguyen: Okay, does it read all the calculations. I just for you here.

1217
02:23:08.730 --> 02:23:10.170
Brian Nguyen: And it's go terminate.

1218
02:23:13.230 --> 02:23:16.620
Brian Nguyen: Now we're going to specify the basis it you know

1219
02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:18.510
Brian Nguyen: Right here.

1220
02:23:19.620 --> 02:23:27.420
Brian Nguyen: This is not the basis that we want to use. So from now on, for all your calculations, we want to use this basis.

1221
02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:30.600
Brian Nguyen: Yes to TV VP.

1222
02:23:31.740 --> 02:23:35.370
Brian Nguyen: Little bit more takes a little bit longer to run the test. Okay.

1223
02:23:36.420 --> 02:23:37.320
Brian Nguyen: I see that

1224
02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:40.230
Brian Nguyen: Leo.

1225
02:23:43.530 --> 02:23:47.640
Brian Nguyen: Okay, you see that everything is deputies up. Perfect.

1226
02:23:52.440 --> 02:23:52.770
Brian Nguyen: Right.

1227
02:23:54.540 --> 02:23:58.440
Brian Nguyen: So down here. Everyone got to the stage.

1228
02:24:01.980 --> 02:24:02.580
Brian Nguyen: Give me a dog.

1229
02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:03.930
Brian Nguyen: Yeah.

1230
02:24:05.340 --> 02:24:07.350
Victoria Choi: I tied it all.

1231
02:24:08.850 --> 02:24:13.950
Victoria Choi: Or be all done TV people. It still says it's spp.

1232
02:24:16.170 --> 02:24:22.650
Brian Nguyen: So what can happen is that you may have typed it incorrectly input the data set up correctly.

1233
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:31.800
Brian Nguyen: To double check scroll up a little bit and make sure that you d all depth to dash all caps PvP

1234
02:24:33.660 --> 02:24:34.680
Victoria Choi: And still

1235
02:24:36.360 --> 02:24:37.140
Victoria Choi: Sneaky.

1236
02:24:41.130 --> 02:24:41.640
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1237
02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:47.100
Brian Nguyen: All right, I'll address that question. Hold that hold that question, they're

1238
02:24:48.750 --> 02:24:49.020
Brian Nguyen: Very

1239
02:24:53.820 --> 02:25:02.040
thanh: Similar happened to me but I kept doing it all deaf to TZ VP in it like work. The third time I tried

1240
02:25:03.210 --> 02:25:03.750
thanh: I'm

1241
02:25:04.620 --> 02:25:05.100
Theresa.

1242
02:25:07.050 --> 02:25:07.830
Theresa Carlos: I haven't seen

1243
02:25:09.210 --> 02:25:13.800
Brian Nguyen: A problem. All right, all right. Why don't you guys share your screen, maybe this

1244
02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:19.290
Aakrsh: Isn't it because

1245
02:25:20.310 --> 02:25:26.190
Aakrsh: If they're doing a different molecule doesn't mean that they're going on like a different like he is. Gosh, something else.

1246
02:25:28.590 --> 02:25:39.270
Brian Nguyen: Now keep in mind, remember when I say what the basis. That is right. Yo, your basis it. Maybe can you try to read it quickly for you guys.

1247
02:25:42.390 --> 02:25:44.190
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so I'm going to clear this

1248
02:25:51.540 --> 02:25:53.010
Brian Nguyen: Remember this right

1249
02:25:54.720 --> 02:25:55.470
Brian Nguyen: Why

1250
02:25:57.030 --> 02:25:57.390
Brian Nguyen: Right.

1251
02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:04.440
Brian Nguyen: Here, right.

1252
02:26:06.810 --> 02:26:07.410
Brian Nguyen: And why

1253
02:26:09.390 --> 02:26:10.590
Brian Nguyen: You want to

1254
02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:18.900
Brian Nguyen: Describe all the points in this space misty space, right. So we can say

1255
02:26:19.980 --> 02:26:22.620
Brian Nguyen: A basis simple basis.

1256
02:26:25.980 --> 02:26:28.680
Brian Nguyen: Simple basic steps will be something like

1257
02:26:30.060 --> 02:26:36.390
Brian Nguyen: 1001

1258
02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:48.690
Brian Nguyen: All right, and this, this is set this graph every single point in this to do. Right, right, because you can say x

1259
02:26:49.710 --> 02:26:50.280
Brian Nguyen: Y.

1260
02:26:51.510 --> 02:26:52.080
Brian Nguyen: Equals

1261
02:26:53.580 --> 02:26:54.810
Brian Nguyen: Some constant one

1262
02:26:56.790 --> 02:26:57.510
Brian Nguyen: One year

1263
02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:00.840
Brian Nguyen: Plus I'm constantly

1264
02:27:05.490 --> 02:27:05.970
Brian Nguyen: One.

1265
02:27:08.250 --> 02:27:13.020
Brian Nguyen: Alright so that said a basis to describe your whole space. Alright.

1266
02:27:14.310 --> 02:27:14.760
Brian Nguyen: So,

1267
02:27:16.980 --> 02:27:18.660
Brian Nguyen: So for every single

1268
02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:21.030
Brian Nguyen: Atom.

1269
02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:34.260
Brian Nguyen: There's a set of basis like this that would describe your atoms are for decades. Right. So the electronic that you're at like the basis it described here.

1270
02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:37.470
Brian Nguyen: Electrons. Okay.

1271
02:27:39.180 --> 02:27:47.280
Brian Nguyen: Let me go back to my terminal. So yes, they are slightly each each atom will be different because they have

1272
02:27:48.330 --> 02:27:49.590
Brian Nguyen: Different number of electrons.

1273
02:27:50.670 --> 02:27:53.370
Brian Nguyen: But the, I think the data.

1274
02:27:56.940 --> 02:28:13.740
Brian Nguyen: The basis it, which represents those atoms are all the same. Right. Okay. It's just that certain atoms had more electrons you have a little bit more more numbers you add to it. Okay, more effective. All right.

1275
02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:15.570
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so, but

1276
02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:24.150
Brian Nguyen: That's the technical stuff. I think there's a little bit more information I can probably sneak in a little bit more. If we keep talking about it.

1277
02:28:25.170 --> 02:28:27.570
Brian Nguyen: Asking you're asking the mentors about it. Okay.

1278
02:28:29.430 --> 02:28:30.720
Brian Nguyen: All right. So does that help

1279
02:28:32.250 --> 02:28:32.580
Aakrsh: Yeah.

1280
02:28:33.420 --> 02:28:40.830
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so for Teresa Victoria and Tom can have one of you guys share your screen. I'll stop sharing my

1281
02:28:44.100 --> 02:28:46.710
Brian Nguyen: Unless you have something you want to add to basis set

1282
02:28:47.880 --> 02:28:50.760
Jeffrey: Of those actually thinking of like

1283
02:28:53.550 --> 02:29:00.060
Jeffrey: illustrating how increasing the basis that size will always make your thing either the same or better.

1284
02:29:01.680 --> 02:29:03.210
Brian Nguyen: Okay, yeah, that's true.

1285
02:29:04.530 --> 02:29:05.010
Jeffrey: So,

1286
02:29:06.720 --> 02:29:07.440
Like it's

1287
02:29:10.470 --> 02:29:15.030
Jeffrey: I don't know, one of the truck, because I'm not good at drawing with a mouse, but

1288
02:29:15.540 --> 02:29:22.950
Brian Nguyen: All right. Okay. Okay, well, hold it another time. Right, you can put in the Word doc or something like that. Okay.

1289
02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:25.620
Yeah.

1290
02:29:26.940 --> 02:29:28.980
Brian Nguyen: All right, I think we talked. You said something

1291
02:29:30.660 --> 02:29:33.240
Victoria Choi: I got my thing to work. It's going now.

1292
02:29:34.230 --> 02:29:39.690
Brian Nguyen: Okay. And it's figured all right let's figure out what happened about what are you guys share, we can see what happened.

1293
02:29:47.400 --> 02:29:47.850
Brian Nguyen: Free

1294
02:29:50.610 --> 02:29:53.130
Brian Nguyen: Ok ok to see all your mistakes.

1295
02:29:55.140 --> 02:30:03.930
thanh: When I did it. I had to type be all stuff too cheesy VP like three times and then it changed from

1296
02:30:04.920 --> 02:30:06.300
Brian Nguyen: Okay, if this ticket.

1297
02:30:07.800 --> 02:30:10.290
Brian Nguyen: For your terminal. I mean, open your share screen.

1298
02:30:18.480 --> 02:30:18.810
Brian Nguyen: Oh,

1299
02:30:19.980 --> 02:30:22.170
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so now let's grow up.

1300
02:30:23.580 --> 02:30:24.120
Brian Nguyen: If you laugh.

1301
02:30:28.770 --> 02:30:30.840
Brian Nguyen: Go, go, go, go, go.

1302
02:30:35.520 --> 02:30:36.750
Brian Nguyen: Away. I see the air.

1303
02:30:38.580 --> 02:30:39.030
Brian Nguyen: Going up

1304
02:30:41.190 --> 02:30:43.560
Brian Nguyen: All right, these it three times. Right. So, this is

1305
02:30:43.560 --> 02:30:43.980
Brian Nguyen: Going

1306
02:30:44.040 --> 02:30:44.970
Brian Nguyen: To where you started.

1307
02:30:46.530 --> 02:30:47.460
Brian Nguyen: When you first started

1308
02:30:52.980 --> 02:31:01.050
Brian Nguyen: Alright, Chris, I think I had this, we had the same air last time yesterday. All right. Okay. So all that good.

1309
02:31:03.540 --> 02:31:03.810
Brian Nguyen: Stuff.

1310
02:31:04.890 --> 02:31:11.940
Brian Nguyen: Right there. Okay, so you use BL right it lists out to the atomic basis it go down.

1311
02:31:14.040 --> 02:31:28.860
Brian Nguyen: Okay list out the data set. Yeah, and I see this error is common. It happens a lot is very common. Okay, so what happened is that this is not the window is not the section where you define your basis.

1312
02:31:31.140 --> 02:31:31.560
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1313
02:31:32.970 --> 02:31:39.090
Brian Nguyen: There you see that you is this out the data set, but this is not the window where you send your message it. Okay.

1314
02:31:40.800 --> 02:31:43.920
Brian Nguyen: And I yet, right. So that's why you go score down

1315
02:31:49.440 --> 02:31:56.460
Brian Nguyen: In Christian the PL it's the same. And he did the same thing again and police gonna be either thing they're

1316
02:31:58.890 --> 02:32:01.560
Brian Nguyen: Going to get a game. Third time

1317
02:32:03.780 --> 02:32:10.260
Brian Nguyen: I grew up up up up his, his was different, your sign your basis in this window.

1318
02:32:11.310 --> 02:32:15.600
Brian Nguyen: Okay. And remember that you're, you have to find your basis in this window.

1319
02:32:16.650 --> 02:32:17.070
Okay.

1320
02:32:18.210 --> 02:32:26.070
Brian Nguyen: That I think that's their the air that's happening. I think Victoria, you had that similar air and Tracy probably had the same layers to

1321
02:32:27.720 --> 02:32:29.430
Brian Nguyen: All right. Okay.

1322
02:32:30.570 --> 02:32:31.170
Brian Nguyen: That makes sense.

1323
02:32:32.400 --> 02:32:34.260
Brian Nguyen: To, to answer your question, guys, y'all.

1324
02:32:36.420 --> 02:32:41.220
Brian Nguyen: Alright. If not, we'll move on. Yeah. Except sharing my screen again.

1325
02:32:46.800 --> 02:32:49.530
Brian Nguyen: Alright, feel free to stop me. Alright.

1326
02:32:51.840 --> 02:32:58.800
Brian Nguyen: Moving on. Okay, here's a basis for our calculation. We're going to do deputies up. Okay.

1327
02:33:01.980 --> 02:33:20.940
Brian Nguyen: Now we're done with that window is on the basis that we now going to generate are more likely to orbital. All right. Anyway, we're going to do is use this command here, he he option. This will generate our initial orbitals and generally as a good enough initial starts

1328
02:33:26.370 --> 02:33:27.780
Brian Nguyen: Calling me and that's

1329
02:33:32.070 --> 02:33:37.020
Brian Nguyen: Okay, yes. So now you just run this calculation you know that this is a neutral.

1330
02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:45.000
Brian Nguyen: I started any type in the default zero. Alright, and we're going to take a step this occupation.

1331
02:33:46.860 --> 02:33:47.190
Brian Nguyen: OK.

1332
02:33:48.780 --> 02:33:52.950
Brian Nguyen: Now we're in this window we set up our parameters that we want.

1333
02:33:53.970 --> 02:33:57.360
Brian Nguyen: For all our calculations. I want you guys to use

1334
02:33:58.950 --> 02:34:01.350
Brian Nguyen: The DSP turn it on.

1335
02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:07.080
Brian Nguyen: Use TCP SSH.

1336
02:34:13.980 --> 02:34:14.400
Brian Nguyen: Move on.

1337
02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:17.340
Brian Nguyen: Feel free to stop me a moment.

1338
02:34:18.570 --> 02:34:26.820
Brian Nguyen: So to our I always use already to the calculation to turn that on and that would assign your theory basis.

1339
02:34:28.140 --> 02:34:28.890
Brian Nguyen: Looking on

1340
02:34:30.450 --> 02:34:32.340
Brian Nguyen: It's not very important.

1341
02:34:33.780 --> 02:34:38.640
Brian Nguyen: At this we call DSP dispersion correction.

1342
02:34:39.810 --> 02:34:54.120
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so just dispersion correction is needed because DSP by itself can't predict knocker index interaction. Very well. And so they have a correction on top of this message. Alright so typing DSP.

1343
02:34:55.350 --> 02:34:59.520
Brian Nguyen: Typing BJ. And it turned out on that can be day. Okay.

1344
02:35:01.680 --> 02:35:02.310
Brian Nguyen: And then

1345
02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:04.950
Brian Nguyen: We're terminate this window.

1346
02:35:06.870 --> 02:35:09.750
Brian Nguyen: Terminate this window. We're done here all we want

1347
02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:12.720
Theresa Carlos: To go back

1348
02:35:14.880 --> 02:35:20.010
Brian Nguyen: Okay, yes, going back up. Yep. Okay, perfect.

1349
02:35:20.520 --> 02:35:25.890
Theresa Carlos: Yeah. After you change it to me because I just think something. Yeah.

1350
02:35:26.580 --> 02:35:31.950
Brian Nguyen: So you want to use this option right after you turn on your computer you can keep in mind.

1351
02:35:32.550 --> 02:35:40.020
Brian Nguyen: That you can change the parameter in any order you want. I just changed the DSP. First, you go are ISIS doesn't matters, right.

1352
02:35:40.620 --> 02:35:56.760
Brian Nguyen: So I changed ESP planners and change our identity added ri. And then last thing is I want to add this dispersion correction is very important because the gap methods can't describe not painting that interaction for well just typing ESP

1353
02:35:57.960 --> 02:35:58.470
Brian Nguyen: We want

1354
02:35:59.790 --> 02:36:03.900
Theresa Carlos: Yes. Yes. How can you change the basis to to do. Do you

1355
02:36:09.930 --> 02:36:13.560
Brian Nguyen: Mean, which section, maybe a little bit more

1356
02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:15.420
Theresa Carlos: Yeah.

1357
02:36:41.640 --> 02:36:42.420
Brian Nguyen: Is not used.

1358
02:36:43.590 --> 02:36:44.280
Brian Nguyen: To turn that on.

1359
02:36:45.030 --> 02:36:48.000
Theresa Carlos: Only me for that because I don't see do

1360
02:36:55.980 --> 02:36:56.040
Brian Nguyen: Quit

1361
02:36:58.950 --> 02:37:00.510
Brian Nguyen: Right. Amen. Sorry.

1362
02:37:04.350 --> 02:37:06.870
Brian Nguyen: This is where you can write your work or go

1363
02:37:09.060 --> 02:37:09.210
Theresa Carlos: To

1364
02:37:10.920 --> 02:37:11.640
Brian Nguyen: ESPN radio

1365
02:37:17.490 --> 02:37:18.840
Brian Nguyen: Okay, before that is

1366
02:37:20.910 --> 02:37:21.510
Brian Nguyen: The basis.

1367
02:37:28.530 --> 02:37:29.970
Brian Nguyen: To terminate that restart.

1368
02:37:31.980 --> 02:37:32.160
Brian Nguyen: Right.

1369
02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:40.020
Brian Nguyen: You're done with this window and the general basis, you're generous and like orbitals see

1370
02:37:43.170 --> 02:37:53.310
Brian Nguyen: All our molecules are going to be neutral or so and I to it. Okay, in a general. Did you say yes, I just entered at times.

1371
02:37:54.630 --> 02:37:59.040
Brian Nguyen: Accurate or neutered chart default zero enter zero doesn't matter.

1372
02:38:00.060 --> 02:38:09.420
Brian Nguyen: On a will give you off the patient few steps as an occupation. Nice. Enter, that's why. All right. And now you're in this window to charge EFT

1373
02:38:10.770 --> 02:38:11.190
Alright.

1374
02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:14.340
Brian Nguyen: Everyone

1375
02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:20.910
Brian Nguyen: turned it on and everyone use dysfunctional TPS se

1376
02:38:21.960 --> 02:38:22.380
Brian Nguyen: Right.

1377
02:38:23.700 --> 02:38:24.630
Brian Nguyen: So remember, type in

1378
02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:35.730
Brian Nguyen: GPS today. Ah. After turning on your deity. Alright, so you guys see all get the same answers right

1379
02:38:38.550 --> 02:38:44.910
Brian Nguyen: They gave you guys all the same structures, right, so we're done here either terminate is right. Enter key or starts

1380
02:38:46.710 --> 02:39:03.210
Brian Nguyen: Next, turn on RI and in our eyes just speeds up the calculation and when can we give you can use it and use it is going to help with your calculations. So our eyes and it just turn on and what are I does it is assigned the basis. That's right.

1381
02:39:04.620 --> 02:39:14.010
Brian Nguyen: A bunch of the faces that right it will read one of them that matches up with your, your topic basis. Okay, going. All right. Anyway, you see that turned on.

1382
02:39:15.480 --> 02:39:16.020
Star.

1383
02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:23.370
Brian Nguyen: And then last thing is the SP turn on this correction.

1384
02:39:25.950 --> 02:39:27.150
Brian Nguyen: And I've been BJ.

1385
02:39:28.320 --> 02:39:31.080
Brian Nguyen: Right. And then, what's that it says these

1386
02:39:32.490 --> 02:39:37.350
Brian Nguyen: Star right and this is the affiliate socially. That's all you need.

1387
02:39:39.450 --> 02:39:41.310
Aakrsh: For DSP just put on

1388
02:39:42.750 --> 02:39:51.000
Brian Nguyen: DST yet to type on right there's option in there just read the option is it she stayed on next grow up again, if you like.

1389
02:39:53.160 --> 02:39:54.960
Brian Nguyen: Right here, there's an option turned on.

1390
02:39:59.670 --> 02:40:07.590
Brian Nguyen: So the on will be it will just it will make a note a program to use this method, basically.

1391
02:40:10.830 --> 02:40:28.980
Brian Nguyen: I will have office hours. If you guys want to know kind of more the different methods and ideas behind it. The concept behind it. I do encourage you guys to go to the office hours, or maybe even tomorrow, we might be around to discuss me a little bit more. Okay.

1392
02:40:30.570 --> 02:40:33.390
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so these are kind of keep probing

1393
02:40:35.160 --> 02:40:41.250
Brian Nguyen: These things over and over again is entry, it'll stick right you understand it, you know. Okay.

1394
02:40:42.420 --> 02:40:44.580
Brian Nguyen: All right, we're done with this defined

1395
02:40:46.350 --> 02:40:51.930
Brian Nguyen: Now you see that. Well, I think there whatever you do, do not

1396
02:40:53.250 --> 02:40:59.790
Brian Nguyen: Run job X, please. Okay. Do not run job. Alright job. Next is

1397
02:41:00.900 --> 02:41:02.370
Brian Nguyen: Geometry optimization

1398
02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:13.560
Brian Nguyen: And I've already optimized be structured so you guys okay so I want you guys to do is just to run our ideas.

1399
02:41:15.180 --> 02:41:17.400
Brian Nguyen: I'll put that our idea out

1400
02:41:18.510 --> 02:41:19.380
Put in person.

1401
02:41:20.490 --> 02:41:23.220
Brian Nguyen: And in the beginning. I've been know hooked

1402
02:41:24.510 --> 02:41:27.510
Brian Nguyen: because somebody's calculation might take a while. Okay.

1403
02:41:28.980 --> 02:41:40.590
Brian Nguyen: All right, and you may not be around to that yet on the calculation. You can just kind of some kind of log out and come back in a few hours later, check on it. Okay.

1404
02:41:42.570 --> 02:41:56.670
Brian Nguyen: What R. I. P. I. P does is it runs a single point energy calculation for given to priests configurations. Okay. Even the way the molecule is configured.

1405
02:41:57.720 --> 02:42:00.420
Brian Nguyen: Maybe I can just run this for now in the background.

1406
02:42:02.370 --> 02:42:08.640
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so it's running now. Okay, I'm going to share whiteboard.

1407
02:42:11.850 --> 02:42:12.480
Brian Nguyen: Clear

1408
02:42:15.420 --> 02:42:17.490
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so it's going to give you an idea.

1409
02:42:20.670 --> 02:42:21.030
Brian Nguyen: Yes.

1410
02:42:23.190 --> 02:42:25.170
Aakrsh: So after these terminated.

1411
02:42:29.700 --> 02:42:32.490
Brian Nguyen: Me show you again, I go back to our terminal.

1412
02:42:32.790 --> 02:42:33.210
Brian Nguyen: My goodness.

1413
02:42:34.350 --> 02:42:39.180
Brian Nguyen: Yeah. So here I didn't know how and what it does, it tells you that runs in the background here.

1414
02:42:39.930 --> 02:42:41.970
Brian Nguyen: Okay, you just press enter again it's time

1415
02:42:45.330 --> 02:42:48.840
Brian Nguyen: Right, and then you'll see the LM s still running as okay

1416
02:42:50.100 --> 02:42:53.790
Brian Nguyen: Now niceness share a whiteboard, so you guys can I know

1417
02:42:55.620 --> 02:42:58.650
Brian Nguyen: You're there a question, I propose usually

1418
02:43:02.370 --> 02:43:03.660
Brian Nguyen: Show relative energy

1419
02:43:06.030 --> 02:43:06.990
Brian Nguyen: A water molecule.

1420
02:43:09.630 --> 02:43:13.470
Brian Nguyen: Okay. So let me draw a water molecule.

1421
02:43:16.380 --> 02:43:16.740
Brian Nguyen: Blue

1422
02:43:19.230 --> 02:43:23.070
Brian Nguyen: Water molecule. Alright, so we have to water molecule one

1423
02:43:24.180 --> 02:43:34.470
Brian Nguyen: And two, and you can tell me which molecules eating has Iran energy or more positive right so we have draw this water molecule.

1424
02:43:45.780 --> 02:43:47.130
Brian Nguyen: Cheers today consistent

1425
02:43:48.960 --> 02:43:49.470
Brian Nguyen: Molecule.

1426
02:44:09.300 --> 02:44:10.110
Brian Nguyen: The question is,

1427
02:44:11.580 --> 02:44:12.780
Brian Nguyen: Which structure.

1428
02:44:15.960 --> 02:44:17.220
Brian Nguyen: Is less stable.

1429
02:44:18.870 --> 02:44:21.150
Brian Nguyen: Maybe higher

1430
02:44:22.620 --> 02:44:23.280
Energy

1431
02:44:25.410 --> 02:44:28.620
Brian Nguyen: Or higher. We call it more positive.

1432
02:44:37.590 --> 02:44:37.830
Brian Nguyen: Thought

1433
02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:49.320
Victoria Choi: Family, I think. Number two is less stable.

1434
02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:51.900
Brian Nguyen: Yeah. Why is that

1435
02:44:53.100 --> 02:44:55.080
Victoria Choi: Because the bond is longer.

1436
02:44:56.100 --> 02:44:56.400
Brian Nguyen: No.

1437
02:44:56.520 --> 02:44:59.310
Victoria Choi: Nothing shorter bonds man like more

1438
02:45:00.750 --> 02:45:01.320
Victoria Choi: Or more stuff.

1439
02:45:05.040 --> 02:45:08.910
Brian Nguyen: Will get back to that will get back to that. Okay, and get back to that.

1440
02:45:11.220 --> 02:45:15.210
Brian Nguyen: Right. So the first statement, you said is, is correct, that is fine as longer

1441
02:45:16.140 --> 02:45:19.110
Brian Nguyen: It's most likely stable. So, yes.

1442
02:45:20.310 --> 02:45:28.110
Brian Nguyen: Your energy of your structure in two will be greater than your structure in one

1443
02:45:31.200 --> 02:45:39.030
Brian Nguyen: Alright everyone agree with that. Just give me a nod did it. Okay, so

1444
02:45:40.140 --> 02:45:43.890
Brian Nguyen: Now let's talk about what the, what the

1445
02:45:45.210 --> 02:45:45.930
Brian Nguyen: Claim

1446
02:45:46.980 --> 02:45:47.430
Brian Nguyen: Was

1447
02:45:48.600 --> 02:45:49.830
Brian Nguyen: That the shorter bond.

1448
02:45:52.320 --> 02:45:52.920
Brian Nguyen: Will mean

1449
02:45:56.250 --> 02:45:59.640
Brian Nguyen: Graders facility, correct, you know, what's your claim.

1450
02:46:00.870 --> 02:46:07.500
Brian Nguyen: Okay. Is that true or false. When ask you guys this true or false.

1451
02:46:14.100 --> 02:46:15.330
Brian Nguyen: Can you prove this.

1452
02:46:25.350 --> 02:46:29.580
Brian Nguyen: What you guys think so. I think Victoria. I want to ask, you know, Teresa.

1453
02:46:30.630 --> 02:46:31.230
Brian Nguyen: What do you think

1454
02:46:33.960 --> 02:46:35.730
Aakrsh: You are more stable.

1455
02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:40.710
Brian Nguyen: Okay. So Chris, you say you agree that sure the bond means great stability.

1456
02:46:41.250 --> 02:46:41.700
Okay.

1457
02:46:43.260 --> 02:46:46.080
Brian Nguyen: Teresa done. But then, yeah.

1458
02:46:46.290 --> 02:46:50.850
thanh: I agree. I'm not shorter bonds, it's more stable.

1459
02:46:56.430 --> 02:46:58.500
Theresa Carlos: And closer to each other.

1460
02:47:00.840 --> 02:47:00.990
Theresa Carlos: To

1461
02:47:04.320 --> 02:47:06.270
Brian Nguyen: See it. Okay.

1462
02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:08.040
Brian Nguyen: All right. Alright.

1463
02:47:09.450 --> 02:47:10.320
Brian Nguyen: I will

1464
02:47:11.880 --> 02:47:12.720
Brian Nguyen: Provide

1465
02:47:14.340 --> 02:47:20.370
Brian Nguyen: See here, you provide me make you rethink that. Again, racist.

1466
02:47:23.850 --> 02:47:29.550
Brian Nguyen: The claim is the shorter bond me the greatest ability

1467
02:47:30.660 --> 02:47:33.810
Brian Nguyen: Right, this is pick something much very easy to think about

1468
02:47:35.730 --> 02:47:36.660
Brian Nguyen: Let's think

1469
02:47:37.980 --> 02:47:38.700
Brian Nguyen: About

1470
02:47:39.720 --> 02:47:44.640
Brian Nguyen: The hydrogen molecule. All right. Yeah, hygiene Molly.

1471
02:47:51.150 --> 02:47:51.690
Brian Nguyen: Molly so

1472
02:47:52.890 --> 02:47:56.040
Brian Nguyen: This makes this day right here. Ah.

1473
02:48:00.390 --> 02:48:01.620
Brian Nguyen: So your claim.

1474
02:48:02.940 --> 02:48:03.540
Brian Nguyen: That this

1475
02:48:04.680 --> 02:48:07.500
Brian Nguyen: Molecule, if you make it even shorter

1476
02:48:09.510 --> 02:48:10.200
Brian Nguyen: Right.

1477
02:48:11.190 --> 02:48:13.050
Aakrsh: No, but there's like good, perfect.

1478
02:48:18.210 --> 02:48:20.940
Brian Nguyen: Yes. There. There we go.

1479
02:48:21.510 --> 02:48:27.060
Aakrsh: So you got him to you too close together the protons and protons will repel each other.

1480
02:48:27.900 --> 02:48:39.840
Brian Nguyen: Right, that's true. Right. So, right. So you're the claim that the shorter bond women greatest ability is not necessarily true. So keep that in mind. Right, so

1481
02:48:41.430 --> 02:48:44.490
Brian Nguyen: There is a equilibrium distance, right. We'll call this

1482
02:48:50.430 --> 02:49:06.360
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so keep that in mind. Be careful when you say certain things right or generalizing stirrings discern certain things. Right, so be careful with that. Right. So this is too short of distance

1483
02:49:07.860 --> 02:49:22.170
Brian Nguyen: The to greater repulsion. Okay, so one of the, one of the things that you learn in theory combination of theoretical chemistry is to be a little bit more precise what you say. Okay.

1484
02:49:23.100 --> 02:49:32.670
Brian Nguyen: So be careful of making drawings gen claims like this. There are always can be a calendar. It may be a counterclaim to this. Okay.

1485
02:49:33.960 --> 02:49:46.170
Brian Nguyen: All right, that's good. So, this is this idea. What we're doing is essentially giving a geometry configuration. We're seeing the energy. Okay, we're not doing a john P optimization. Alright.

1486
02:49:47.070 --> 02:50:03.690
Brian Nguyen: So now let's go back to my calculation in st is how we do how we're doing is it's done. Okay, great. Okay, so if you guys look at your output or idea of tea. I'll go over the summer output with you guys.

1487
02:50:07.170 --> 02:50:08.430
Brian Nguyen: Are at UT out

1488
02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:11.220
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1489
02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:23.340
Brian Nguyen: In the last 10 minutes which is going to look over on the output to the guys kind of familiarize what's happening here. Right. So the goal is already up to the total energy given at all and reconfiguration

1490
02:50:23.820 --> 02:50:48.960
Brian Nguyen: And so here's what it is you get your authors know give them some credit. These are people who, who developed this program. Alright, bunch of stuff center stuff. All right here. What is this the message up SSH. Okay. You turn on ri. Good. Mr. Mr. Remember, you gave it good.

1491
02:50:51.480 --> 02:50:55.140
Brian Nguyen: Okay, good reading the basis sets we didn't have to add them. All right.

1492
02:50:56.190 --> 02:51:00.570
Brian Nguyen: He does in the cemetery of the molecule and

1493
02:51:01.620 --> 02:51:07.560
Brian Nguyen: This is dispersion correction is here, just think that we, you were using EFT three or

1494
02:51:08.640 --> 02:51:17.520
Brian Nguyen: Four down either some parameters. They set up corrections you set up to worry too much about the details, use some of the integral. Okay.

1495
02:51:18.780 --> 02:51:21.720
Brian Nguyen: Competing to energy right here's the most important

1496
02:51:22.740 --> 02:51:25.020
Brian Nguyen: Digital a call it sex iteration.

1497
02:51:26.100 --> 02:51:27.420
Brian Nguyen: FCS stands for

1498
02:51:29.520 --> 02:51:30.000
Brian Nguyen: Now,

1499
02:51:32.880 --> 02:51:35.520
Brian Nguyen: SPS stands for. So

1500
02:51:36.780 --> 02:51:37.710
Brian Nguyen: Consistent

1501
02:51:39.900 --> 02:51:44.910
Brian Nguyen: Deal. Alright, is a what we call a way a set of equation that we do to

1502
02:51:46.620 --> 02:51:56.220
Brian Nguyen: Find that we can converge our energy. Okay, so our first initial guests for electronic configuration you can be this energy here.

1503
02:51:57.270 --> 02:52:03.540
Brian Nguyen: And you go into each iteration, you'll notice that the total energy. It's slower and I believe if you

1504
02:52:06.090 --> 02:52:15.390
Brian Nguyen: Sum up these two energies, it should equal to something that so this energy plus times I to

1505
02:52:17.340 --> 02:52:24.120
Brian Nguyen: Have this energy issue equal does something like that. But don't worry about that too much. That's the finer details were interested in total energy

1506
02:52:25.830 --> 02:52:32.370
Brian Nguyen: Which notice that the energy goes gets lower, which is what we want. Right. Sometimes you will see the energy fluctuating

1507
02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:38.760
Brian Nguyen: Right, and then you'll have to kind of adjust the parameters and things like that. So far so good with lowering energy

1508
02:52:39.540 --> 02:52:56.100
Brian Nguyen: getting smaller and smaller. You know the differences are getting smaller, right, they would come to a point where we say that the energy so small that call it converge of you get the energy to groups like the difference between these two guys are free, which the state, right.

1509
02:52:57.510 --> 02:53:06.030
Brian Nguyen: Now the final calculation of that. All right. And this is our total energy that we're interested in is how the integration took

1510
02:53:07.140 --> 02:53:07.530
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1511
02:53:08.580 --> 02:53:19.290
Brian Nguyen: And these are some of the common orbitals information or a scrolling down and more information. Here's how much time it took. All right, so it's pretty fast, right.

1512
02:53:21.600 --> 02:53:23.820
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so now what we're going to do.

1513
02:53:25.140 --> 02:53:27.750
Brian Nguyen: For now add any more. So

1514
02:53:28.860 --> 02:53:31.200
Brian Nguyen: What we're going to do is for you guys.

1515
02:53:32.610 --> 02:53:33.930
Brian Nguyen: To do it.

1516
02:53:34.050 --> 02:53:35.340
Brian Nguyen: For all these molecules.

1517
02:53:35.760 --> 02:53:40.350
Brian Nguyen: Right, go through the same steps money, our ideas and then on Monday.

1518
02:53:41.760 --> 02:53:48.000
Brian Nguyen: We'll take a look at those energies main compute our own binding energy. Okay.

1519
02:53:48.690 --> 02:53:49.950
Aakrsh: Remember on Tuesday.

1520
02:53:51.930 --> 02:54:00.120
Brian Nguyen: Sorry to that. Correct. Right. Is it yes you say because Monday the chemistry department is hosting the

1521
02:54:01.320 --> 02:54:02.460
Brian Nguyen: anti racist.

1522
02:54:04.830 --> 02:54:13.800
Brian Nguyen: Campaign in physical sciences. If you guys are interested. Hope it all for you guys to the zoom link or in the email.

1523
02:54:15.030 --> 02:54:18.690
Brian Nguyen: You guys can attend it is that 11 o'clock on Monday I

1524
02:54:19.800 --> 02:54:25.110
Brian Nguyen: Believe that level. Yeah. Okay. So, no, no, it could be interesting. Let's take a look at it.

1525
02:54:26.520 --> 02:54:32.520
Brian Nguyen: And it will continue this on on Tuesday. I'll have office hours on Wednesday dead.

1526
02:54:35.370 --> 02:54:36.540
Brian Nguyen: Maybe Monday to

1527
02:54:37.620 --> 02:54:40.110
Brian Nguyen: Thursday case it. How's that sound.

1528
02:54:42.090 --> 02:54:53.400
Brian Nguyen: You guys need more help on Monday. OK, so I'll have office hours are Monday as well. All right, I'll send that out to email. All right, and I send an invitation. Right.

1529
02:54:54.870 --> 02:54:57.690
Brian Nguyen: So that's probably the last last five minutes.

1530
02:54:59.670 --> 02:55:02.190
Brian Nguyen: I have questions I can answer. We start with that.

1531
02:55:03.750 --> 02:55:04.440
Brian Nguyen: What we're doing

1532
02:55:06.750 --> 02:55:19.230
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so that's the technical things. So hopefully we'll be able to answer that question why and confirm that the sending dimer in a T shaped configuration and the standard configurations more stable.

1533
02:55:20.520 --> 02:55:23.790
Brian Nguyen: Into one day we complete overlay. Right. Okay.

1534
02:55:24.930 --> 02:55:26.100
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so

1535
02:55:27.120 --> 02:55:27.540
Brian Nguyen: That

1536
02:55:29.100 --> 02:55:30.330
Brian Nguyen: If I have for you guys.

1537
02:55:34.530 --> 02:55:42.930
Brian Nguyen: So I think that's a little small assignment for you guys to do over the weekend. All right. I think it should be doable or not too bad.

1538
02:55:44.610 --> 02:55:49.890

1542
02:56:16.650 --> 02:56:17.040
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1543
02:56:20.550 --> 02:56:22.470
Brian Nguyen: This is a correct notation, but in

1544
02:56:23.580 --> 02:56:24.570
Brian Nguyen: In define

1545
02:56:26.700 --> 02:56:27.540
Brian Nguyen: It's written as

1546
02:56:28.740 --> 02:56:30.120
Brian Nguyen: This okay

1547
02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:37.380
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1548
02:56:41.490 --> 02:56:42.510
Brian Nguyen: Get your feedback.

1549
02:56:43.980 --> 02:56:45.300
Brian Nguyen: Will you guys think so far.

1550
02:56:50.460 --> 02:56:59.280
Brian Nguyen: Sorry, I should I should a little late today. No, no, is Jeffrey told you that. Yeah, I was picking up cards car.

1551
02:57:07.020 --> 02:57:09.090

1552
02:57:10.260 --> 02:57:18.720
Brian Nguyen: Good. Thumbs up. Alright. Is it enjoyable that hard. This is little difficulty.

1553
02:57:20.670 --> 02:57:24.780
Aakrsh: Because we're at the beginning like learning how to do it, but like once you get the hang of it. Something happen.

1554
02:57:25.920 --> 02:57:26.160
Yeah.

1555
02:57:31.290 --> 02:57:41.370
Brian Nguyen: I kinda I want to try to, you know, one of the things that I didn't get much was that people show me how to run a calculation.

1556
02:57:42.540 --> 02:57:44.490
Brian Nguyen: But never really understood

1557
02:57:45.720 --> 02:57:53.700
Brian Nguyen: What and what's the, what's the energy of what really is it really doing know it. How are, how are we getting these numbers right and show

1558
02:57:54.690 --> 02:58:10.410
Brian Nguyen: My tactic for you is with to kind of give a little bit information. Little bit more kind of simplify it and eventually, you know, as you're working with us a little bit more, there's constant will come back, but I'll add a little bit more to it and make it a little bit more complex. Right.

1559
02:58:12.120 --> 02:58:12.480
Then

1560
02:58:15.330 --> 02:58:26.430
Brian Nguyen: This is, you know, sciences is a constant discussion between try to write social, feel free to ask question, right, is it okay to make mistakes. Okay, say,

1561
02:58:30.480 --> 02:58:31.110
Brian Nguyen: Other comments.

1562
02:58:42.330 --> 02:58:46.020
Theresa Carlos: So on. On Tuesday, will be meeting meeting at the same time.

1563
02:58:47.550 --> 02:58:48.780
Brian Nguyen: To say

1564
02:58:51.750 --> 02:58:53.280
Brian Nguyen: And be speaking about it.

1565
02:58:56.730 --> 02:59:02.340
Brian Nguyen: I think it might be beneficial to me at nine. All right, but

1566
02:59:05.940 --> 02:59:09.510
Brian Nguyen: I think I made it shorter, this time. So if it's just 10 to 12

1567
02:59:10.800 --> 02:59:13.590
Brian Nguyen: So the first half is the mentor presentation.

1568
02:59:14.880 --> 02:59:20.850
Brian Nguyen: I can, you know, stick around a little bit longer. You guys need more. So we have a few more things we want to show

1569
02:59:22.440 --> 02:59:25.980
Brian Nguyen: So we'll finish up this on previous interactions.

1570
02:59:27.480 --> 02:59:39.720
Brian Nguyen: You know, hopefully you guys able to get to get the numbers will do the computation here. So compare numbers and then one last thing we like to show it to visualize molecular orbital.

1571
02:59:40.920 --> 02:59:51.360
Brian Nguyen: It's one of the handy tool that you will need to kind of understand, you know, kind of, how are, how are these properties coming from where he's coming from. Okay.

1572
02:59:52.470 --> 02:59:53.910
Brian Nguyen: So that's the last thing we'll show

1573
02:59:55.500 --> 03:00:03.030
Brian Nguyen: Which will these pretty much all of these, these commands being said we're talking about you will more or less use them.

1574
03:00:04.680 --> 03:00:10.050
Brian Nguyen: Quite a lot, right, and there'll be more to learn from it. Right. Okay.

Brian Nguyen: send you some advice on to be successful.

1580
03:01:02.010 --> 03:01:11.160
Brian Nguyen: College. It is college app. Well, I think a few of them got full ride scholarships to colleges. So it's a nice so maybe you can ask them about that too.

1581
03:01:13.980 --> 03:01:26.700
Brian Nguyen: Some of them guys to like Berkeley Stanford. Some of them have very unique stories. I think one of them went to stare for top functioning on half a brain.

1582
03:01:28.650 --> 03:01:30.840
Brian Nguyen: So what happened was that she would

1583
03:01:32.460 --> 03:01:44.970
Brian Nguyen: She was born, I think they were half her brain. She would have like a conjoined twin, basically. And I think one of her brain was like no, it was

1584
03:01:47.250 --> 03:01:57.420
Brian Nguyen: Not functioning very well or some sort also give you more detail. And then I see what she went through those challenges. So it's pretty cool like well

1585
03:01:58.470 --> 03:01:58.770
