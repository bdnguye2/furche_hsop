1
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.900
Brian Nguyen: All right, quick question for everyone.

2
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.900
Brian Nguyen: A quick. Do you guys have questions as always just learn on Monday.

3
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.300
Brian Nguyen: Before we get started.

4
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:31.380
Brian Nguyen: So Chris, come back. Okay. Looks like you guys all got it experts. Okay. Alright, so

5
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.920
Brian Nguyen: This is important, right before you get started. Okay. I hope you guys have organized your folders. Okay.

6
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.610
Brian Nguyen: Not yet okay it's okay right there. He says, okay, so

7
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:58.110
Brian Nguyen: For Windows users here. Please keep in mind that we want. We're going to want to save all your files in this for special now.

8
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.320
Brian Nguyen: Let's see here. I hope you guys know what I'm talking about the retreat and Victoria, you have Windows right

9
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.420
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so just keeping my from now on. Please save all your files in that directory. Okay.

10
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.820
Brian Nguyen: Not, you know, your home directory for town in case you guys have Mac. So you're fine, don't worry about that. Okay.

11
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.460
Brian Nguyen: started pulling stuff.

12
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.310
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

13
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.690
Brian Nguyen: We're gonna get started on this.

14
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:58.770
Brian Nguyen: Will be talking about how to use purple is the program that professors Jorge, and many other people around the world has been developing

15
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:14.550
Brian Nguyen: And this program essentially helps us to use rows of calculations. And one of the things that we're deeply interested in is competing energies total energy on your molecule. All right.

16
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:26.310
Brian Nguyen: Let's get started. Let's ask everyone to like the VPN you guys to keep the and for me.

17
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.100
Brian Nguyen: The minute I get shut up.

18
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.000
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

19
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.480
Brian Nguyen: So,

20
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.020
Theresa Carlos: I think I have to log into my account. So be nice.

21
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.810
Brian Nguyen: All right.

22
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.660
Brian Nguyen: You guys have VPN. Good. All right.

23
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.510
Brian Nguyen: Hey, we're going to do. Let's get started. Okay.

24
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.970
Brian Nguyen: Okay, go.

25
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.790
Brian Nguyen: Started okay I'm gonna share my screen.

26
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.170
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so the first thing we want to do.

27
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.080
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

28
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.470
Brian Nguyen: So, first thing we want to do.

29
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:04.920
Brian Nguyen: Is we want to open up avocado. Okay everyone, open up your average Manager Program.

30
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.370
Brian Nguyen: Terminal

31
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.220
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so before we start playing with avocado.

32
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:47.190
Brian Nguyen: Please as make a directory or in any any any folder you want. So either you like in this desktop.

33
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.790
Brian Nguyen: Documents. Okay, let's discuss it says go to documents.

34
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:09.090
Brian Nguyen: Or wherever you want to save your folder. Okay, so we're going to make a folder called make directory parish high school outreach. All right.

35
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.140
Brian Nguyen: You can make that anywhere you save it anywhere.

36
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:23.940
Brian Nguyen: Feel free to stop me if you have questions about some bands which is kind of pretty much move pretty quickly. Alright, alright, so here is fish.

37
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.370
Brian Nguyen: And it will make

38
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.430
Brian Nguyen: A folder called geo

39
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.030
Brian Nguyen: Water

40
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.390
Brian Nguyen: Alright so what we're gonna do is

41
00:05:40.860 --> 00:06:01.830
Brian Nguyen: Create a water molecule and they were no performance geometry optimization. What I mean by that is keeping the honey. The ground state energy of your molecule, but I'll explain that as we go. So first we're going to start to go into molecule first. Okay, so let's just make it very simple

42
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:17.400
Brian Nguyen: We just need to get smaller COSA oxygen and pop. There's water molecule, very easy and simple its most simplest case, you know, we can work with. All right.

43
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.590
Brian Nguyen: And then

44
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.180
Brian Nguyen: You want to minimize this molecule first.

45
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.490
Brian Nguyen: Start

46
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.990
Brian Nguyen: Right, and then you see some numbers.

47
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.030
Brian Nguyen: Are there, stop.

48
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:40.890
Brian Nguyen: All right, and then you want to save this. Alright. Save As.

49
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.870
Brian Nguyen: And are you want to go to the folder that gets created.

50
00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.460
Brian Nguyen: I created it was the first underscore agents okie

51
00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:03.390
Brian Nguyen: She'll off right in a file type I want is to XYZ XYZ

52
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:18.540
Brian Nguyen: Okay, just to know what what is x, y, z is you can think guess it's the Cartesian coordinates and that gives you the position of all your atoms oxygen, water, oxygen, hydrogen atom that

53
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:30.960
Brian Nguyen: They will save it just call it water got XYZ right to some whatever name that is most useful for you. All right. It just makes sense to me anything.

54
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:32.730
Brian Nguyen: Usually

55
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:34.620
Brian Nguyen: Right and save

56
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.400
Brian Nguyen: All right. Okay.

57
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:57.210
Brian Nguyen: So what we have here is a guess. Okay. Initial guest and we're going to take that initial test and ever run a quantum calculation on it to get a little bit more accurate results. Okay. Alright. So before I continue on.

58
00:07:58.530 --> 00:07:58.860
Brian Nguyen: So,

59
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.720
Brian Nguyen: For you. I have one question for you guys.

60
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:10.380
Brian Nguyen: Is that since we just made a water molecule here, right.

61
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:17.490
Brian Nguyen: How do we compete. How do we get the energy just from from this water molecule.

62
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:30.570
Brian Nguyen: tikka tikka tikka tikka Victoria stuff by last yesterday. Now, sorry I gave her the answer already. So I want to keep you guys a chance to answer this. So,

63
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.560
Brian Nguyen: On the Christian Teresa.

64
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.810
Brian Nguyen: What do you guys think

65
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.570
Brian Nguyen: How do you get the energy. Where do you think the energy comes from

66
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:20.940
Brian Nguyen: Um,

67
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.650
Brian Nguyen: You take me to, you know,

68
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:38.220
Brian Nguyen: Just simply take this molecule, take the x, y, z coordinate and put into a machine, you know it output to the energy right so

69
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:51.000
Brian Nguyen: We're, we're more our group, a little bit more, you know, like they're a little bit know a little bit more than just, you know, getting a number, we understand how to get the numbers right so maybe next question is

70
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:59.490
Brian Nguyen: We see that there are bond right prevented bond, a bond has energy right

71
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:01.110
Brian Nguyen: Right.

72
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:07.110
Brian Nguyen: So that chemistry, you'll know that you can probably compete know

73
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.830
Brian Nguyen: Now relative energies, they can bond.

74
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:18.060
Brian Nguyen: On a beach right right reactions and all that. Right. Okay. What

75
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.190
Brian Nguyen: Other questions, then where are these bond energies coming comes in.

76
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:31.350
Brian Nguyen: Right, so it goes back to your question. Okay, so then we're adding tomato really good

77
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.310
thanh: Protons, neutrons and electrons.

78
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:48.240
Brian Nguyen: Yeah. Good. Great. That's perfect. Yes, that's the answer I'm looking at. So we got to look at a very small sub atomic level like protons, neutrons and electrons. Alright.

79
00:10:48.990 --> 00:11:11.820
Brian Nguyen: Until we're interested in those type of interactions between atoms. Okay, and we're going to be using their Cartesian coordinates of these arrows Adams to complete those energies and those interactions. Alright. So the thing about about this year is that we're only interested in the electrons.

80
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:20.940
Brian Nguyen: Right. And what is that you think is this is like a this is a textbook answer.

81
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.840
Brian Nguyen: In the past, I've read many times

82
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:34.800
Brian Nguyen: May be able to guide to there is what determines the chemical properties of a molecule.

83
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:36.810
You see,

84
00:11:58.650 --> 00:11:59.550
Brian Nguyen: Power Shell

85
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:02.820
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, Adam.

86
00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.170
thanh: Means electrons.

87
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:10.980
Brian Nguyen: Yesterday electron. So the valence electrons is the one that really determines the chemical properties.

88
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.510
Brian Nguyen: Of these

89
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.590
Brian Nguyen: These molecules. And we're actually continuing those interactions.

90
00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.800
Brian Nguyen: Okay. And so let's listen for anything that

91
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.060
Brian Nguyen: You get out of this.

92
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:23.100
Brian Nguyen: Question.

93
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.380
Brian Nguyen: Yes, so

94
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.560
Theresa Carlos: I have a question. So I was like, I kind of missed the

95
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.580
Theresa Carlos: Beginning. So I

96
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:33.120
Get

97
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:34.680
Theresa Carlos: Open

98
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.590
Brian Nguyen: Yes, yes. Open avocado and then

99
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.770
Brian Nguyen: Create a water molecule.

100
00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:44.970
Alright.

101
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.250
Brian Nguyen: And so

102
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.780
Brian Nguyen: Wait, before

103
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.770
We open

104
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.860
Brian Nguyen: Up of God so

105
00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.420
Go to your terminal.

106
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.060
Brian Nguyen: And remember where I said,

107
00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:58.350
Brian Nguyen: To stave off.

108
00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.850
Brian Nguyen: To like save all your files.

109
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.300
Brian Nguyen: Or windows, you had to go into CD for splash out

110
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.070
Brian Nguyen: Just like that.

111
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:07.410
Brian Nguyen: I think

112
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.710
Brian Nguyen: When I have asked Jeffrey, help me out here. Can you

113
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:12.270
Brian Nguyen: messaged her

114
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.500
Brian Nguyen: via chat.

115
00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.250
Jeffrey Tsai: Message to the

116
00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.520
Brian Nguyen: Folder. Yeah. Yep.

117
00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.280
Jeffrey Tsai: So it's mounts.

118
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.840
Jeffrey Tsai: And see

119
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.580
Jeffrey Tsai: For the drive and

120
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.070
Aakrsh: Should be the username right

121
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.560
Aakrsh: Yeah yeah

122
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.060
Brian Nguyen: Yeah message that to

123
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.080
Brian Nguyen: Chat to her.

124
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.580
Brian Nguyen: I'd like to come on

125
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:42.900
Aakrsh: Okay, thank you.

126
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.340
Aakrsh: Open up my Ubuntu subsystem of

127
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.870
Jeffrey Tsai: My other laptop to them.

128
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:49.980
All right.

129
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:52.590
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so

130
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.570
Brian Nguyen: It's, it's, once you make molecule.

131
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:56.640
When think we were discussing

132
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.060
Brian Nguyen: Like once we have this molecule.

133
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:01.500
Brian Nguyen: We're going to save the file.

134
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.000
Brian Nguyen: I say that

135
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:04.080
All right.

136
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.230
Brian Nguyen: And it makes sure you're in the

137
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:07.980
Brian Nguyen: Right order to

138
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:08.400
Create

139
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.350
Brian Nguyen: So make sure you're in the form that you want to

140
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.890
Aakrsh: Put the in

141
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.410
Brian Nguyen: All right. Okay, we're gonna leave

142
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.940
Brian Nguyen: Me. We're gonna need to export the

143
00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:24.990
Brian Nguyen: File later on. Okay, we want to say this XYZ XYZ is the format good senior Cartesian

144
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.410
Aakrsh: Coordinates.

145
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.130
Aakrsh: Of the items.

146
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.740
Brian Nguyen: Xyz physician. Alright.

147
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.570
Aakrsh: Just say, or

148
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:32.730
Brian Nguyen: Water dot x, y, z.

149
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.510
Brian Nguyen: Or is that somewhere will accidentally

150
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.660
Brian Nguyen: Terminal. Alright, alright. So before we

151
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.420
Aakrsh: Will go on to the next step.

152
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.460
Aakrsh: Share

153
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:46.470
Aakrsh: The concept of

154
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:47.100
Energy

155
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:49.500
You know,

156
00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.580
I believe

157
00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.660
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so

158
00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.810
Brian Nguyen: Quick survey. Here I believe there's a mix.

159
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.250
Brian Nguyen: So has everyone taking

160
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.480
AP Chemistry. Yes.

161
00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:08.640
Aakrsh: Yes.

162
00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.440
Brian Nguyen: Okay, Chris, you're

163
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.130
Taking it

164
00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.820
Brian Nguyen: On mutation is Theresa you're taking AP chemistry.

165
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.950
Brian Nguyen: Okay and Victoria. Alright, so

166
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:21.120
Aakrsh: That's not

167
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.890
Aakrsh: That's okay, well,

168
00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:24.240
Brian Nguyen: I'll try to give you guys two spaces.

169
00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:25.200
Brian Nguyen: So far,

170
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.490
Brian Nguyen: So when we didn't know

171
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:27.570
It.

172
00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.140
Aakrsh: We have the

173
00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.160
Aakrsh: Earth and talk about quantum chemistry.

174
00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:41.280
Brian Nguyen: And when we talk about quantum mechanics, Steve, we always go back to talking about

175
00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:42.600
Brian Nguyen: The group.

176
00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:43.770
Injury.

177
00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:46.680
Brian Nguyen: Right.

178
00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.210
Brian Nguyen: We're all

179
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.320
Brian Nguyen: Trying to solve.

180
00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.160
Jeffrey Tsai: That I quit. I

181
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.170
Brian Nguyen: hear someone saying something.

182
00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:58.320
Brian Nguyen: Right there, we're trying to solve.

183
00:15:58.890 --> 00:15:59.550
Brian Nguyen: The equation.

184
00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.820
Brian Nguyen: And it's good replacement is

185
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.540
Brian Nguyen: He I

186
00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:08.160
Mean

187
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:11.460
Aakrsh: He died.

188
00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:16.620
Brian Nguyen: Right.

189
00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:18.750
Brian Nguyen: There's a little hat.

190
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.060
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so

191
00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:33.180
Brian Nguyen: Here is the total energy. So I'm giving you here is a very basic really introduction to energies. Right. How do you get to see it. So he says here is

192
00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.610
Brian Nguyen: If we call h recall is an operator.

193
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:49.050
Brian Nguyen: And operators and operator is essential to whatever mathematical

194
00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:49.830
Aakrsh: Function.

195
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:51.150
You have

196
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:53.070
Brian Nguyen: That operates.

197
00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:54.930
Brian Nguyen: On to your boy function.

198
00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.500
Brian Nguyen: Right, so a function can be you know

199
00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.960
Brian Nguyen: They're away from cheek. Think of it as

200
00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:10.230
Brian Nguyen: Something that describes your system. Okay. And we'll call that side. Okay, so this symbol is caused by

201
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:13.530
Brian Nguyen: The way function.

202
00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.170
Brian Nguyen: describing your system.

203
00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:22.830
Brian Nguyen: Okay. Sometimes we call it, we kind of joke around

204
00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:24.240
Brian Nguyen: And say that

205
00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.560
Brian Nguyen: You know, we can take over the

206
00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.930
Brian Nguyen: Waste function as the equation of life.

207
00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.260
Brian Nguyen: And if someone can find that equation in life, and they can

208
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:41.250
Brian Nguyen: Make a bunch of money, you know, can I say so that's why we all we have to check out this job, essentially, right, and he is the

209
00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.850
Brian Nguyen: Total energy. Okay.

210
00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.120
Brian Nguyen: And he is just a number.

211
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:52.830
Brian Nguyen: Okay, what it does upgrade does operates on

212
00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:59.040
Brian Nguyen: Its way function. It's out an energy and also the way function is so

213
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:00.570
Brian Nguyen: All right.

214
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:01.920
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

215
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.550
Brian Nguyen: drop their questions guys

216
00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.220
Aakrsh: All right, so

217
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.260
Brian Nguyen: All right, so then

218
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:14.490
Brian Nguyen: Me move

219
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:17.640
Brian Nguyen: This

220
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.710
Brian Nguyen: I bet. All right. This is the total energy

221
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:43.710
Brian Nguyen: He is an operator and this is also known as the Hamiltonian. And so we're, what we're going to write the Hamiltonian

222
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:46.140
Right, the Hamiltonian

223
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.890
Brian Nguyen: They just said she ate.

224
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.090
Aakrsh: The Hamiltonian will give you the total energy. Okay.

225
00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.430
Brian Nguyen: When we think of total energy

226
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:01.950
Brian Nguyen: Right essentially says

227
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:04.530
Brian Nguyen: Total energy is

228
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:10.200
Brian Nguyen: The sum of your kinetic energy and your potential energy part. Correct.

229
00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.600
Brian Nguyen: And that's in physics somewhere.

230
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:15.570
Brian Nguyen: One example is, you can think

231
00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:16.230
Brian Nguyen: Of is

232
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.160
Brian Nguyen: Kind of the

233
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:18.780
The hill.

234
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:20.790
Brian Nguyen: Right.

235
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.650
Brian Nguyen: At the

236
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:26.580
Brian Nguyen: Bottom of this hill.

237
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.330
Brian Nguyen: Is purely kinetic energy.

238
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:32.610
Brian Nguyen: Right.

239
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:36.570
Aakrsh: At the top of the hill.

240
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:37.830
It's purely

241
00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.950
Aakrsh: Potential energy right

242
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:47.070
Brian Nguyen: Right. And in between is some there is

243
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.980
Brian Nguyen: Some between Canadian central

244
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:51.720
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

245
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:54.690
Aakrsh: So what is right.

246
00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.720
Brian Nguyen: In here, the Hamiltonian two ways typically written

247
00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.680
Brian Nguyen: That t

248
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:59.400
T

249
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:01.710
Aakrsh: Plus

250
00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:03.030
The

251
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:06.180
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

252
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:09.210
Aakrsh: So, T is your energy.

253
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:18.000
Aakrsh: Operator and

254
00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:18.960
Brian Nguyen: He is the

255
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.480
Brian Nguyen: Potential energy operator.

256
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:24.060
Aakrsh: Right.

257
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:26.880
Brian Nguyen: Important to know

258
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:32.730
Brian Nguyen: Before we get started, like this is how we compete the energy generally alright

259
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.440
Brian Nguyen: So,

260
00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:38.010
Brian Nguyen: The question then becomes, is what

261
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.200
Brian Nguyen: Is the form of form as a

262
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.970
Brian Nguyen: Kind of energy and passion energy

263
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.890
Brian Nguyen: Well, let's start with the kinetic energy.

264
00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.460
Brian Nguyen: Internet much easier to think about

265
00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:49.620
Brian Nguyen: So,

266
00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:58.770
Brian Nguyen: Oh wait, what do you guys think this negative energy

267
00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:00.120
Brian Nguyen: Author is like

268
00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:03.150
Aakrsh: The kinetic

269
00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.870
Brian Nguyen: Energy operator is actually very similar

270
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.490
Brian Nguyen: very analogous

271
00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.940
Brian Nguyen: To the kinetic energy that you're familiar with.

272
00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:12.750
Aakrsh: The in

273
00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:13.770
Physics.

274
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.350
Brian Nguyen: Like one half.

275
00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:19.560
Brian Nguyen: And the square

276
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.030
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

277
00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.510
Brian Nguyen: This is a kinetic energy to you. You're very similar

278
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:30.570
Brian Nguyen: Wishes from your physics class, but in this case.

279
00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.370
Brian Nguyen: Regarding replaces

280
00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:33.780
Brian Nguyen: The square

281
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:38.730
With a

282
00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.360
Aakrsh: Second derivative. Okay.

283
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.500
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so that's just kind of started, you guys.

284
00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:55.920
Aakrsh: Know,

285
00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.560
Brian Nguyen: All right, it's very similar.

286
00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:00.150
Aakrsh: To what you see. And you can just

287
00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:01.170
Brian Nguyen: Visit because okay

288
00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:02.970
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so

289
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.810
Brian Nguyen: We'll go ahead and dive into too much to the math details.

290
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:07.740
Aakrsh: But just kind of

291
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:10.560
Brian Nguyen: Be familiar with it. All right. And for v.

292
00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.850
Brian Nguyen: Is that the potential and this part.

293
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.300
Brian Nguyen: This piece is where we actually describe the interaction.

294
00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.730
Brian Nguyen: On a subatomic level.

295
00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:21.390
Brian Nguyen: All right.

296
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:26.610
Aakrsh: Remember back when we were talking about protons and electrons, right, we're interested in those

297
00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:29.730
Brian Nguyen: Types of interactions. And so we have the

298
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:36.450
Brian Nguyen: Will some this right this this way, and he

299
00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.370
Brian Nguyen: All right, to

300
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:39.930
Aakrsh: The neutron

301
00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.280
Aakrsh: He's electron

302
00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:43.620
Brian Nguyen: Is the interaction between the electrons, neutrons,

303
00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:44.730
Plus

304
00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.920
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, think about our water molecule.

305
00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.720
Brian Nguyen: What other interaction are there.

306
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.800
Brian Nguyen: Right.

307
00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.740
Brian Nguyen: And so the interaction or new challenges and I neutron

308
00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.740
Brian Nguyen: Right and plus

309
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:00.990
Brian Nguyen: The interaction.

310
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.700
Brian Nguyen: Between

311
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:03.690
The electrons.

312
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.850
Brian Nguyen: All right. Okay. Have questions there.

313
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:15.240
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so

314
00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.370
Brian Nguyen: What we know

315
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.350
Aakrsh: Is that

316
00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.680
Brian Nguyen: We can approximate these guys.

317
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.030
Brian Nguyen: Because of an approximation.

318
00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:30.000
Brian Nguyen: In approximate

319
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:37.590
Brian Nguyen: Any

320
00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:40.560
Aakrsh: With the born

321
00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.020
Brian Nguyen: Oppenheimer approximation.

322
00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:45.780
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

323
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:46.980
This

324
00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:49.590
Aakrsh: Born

325
00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:59.910
Brian Nguyen: Oppenheimer approximation makes an approximation where it says that if you look at the electron and you look at the there's a proton, neutron

326
00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:00.480
Aakrsh: Right.

327
00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.660
Brian Nguyen: The match between those two particles.

328
00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:07.710
Aakrsh: Is almost significantly very different. Right.

329
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:10.830
Brian Nguyen: The protons much much much much heavier, the

330
00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.810
Brian Nguyen: Electrons right

331
00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:18.570
Brian Nguyen: We can approximate by saying that they let the neutrons, much, much slower.

332
00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:23.190
Brian Nguyen: And look at it, just a simple, you know,

333
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:26.820
Aakrsh: It's a simple point charge or something.

334
00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:27.420
Brian Nguyen: Like that.

335
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:30.210
Brian Nguyen: Okay. And so for

336
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.820
Brian Nguyen: The thing that we're ultimately interested in

337
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:35.040
Brian Nguyen: Is this one.

338
00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:45.060
Brian Nguyen: And this is where it gets very, very difficult to compete is the electronic electronic interaction. Okay. There's a reason why

339
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:47.430
Brian Nguyen: I won't dig into some actually

340
00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.860
Brian Nguyen: Chima but you stopped by tomorrow, I might

341
00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:51.720
Brian Nguyen: Explain. I can explain a little bit more

342
00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:52.470
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

343
00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.620
Brian Nguyen: Explain. Where does this come from, alright.

344
00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:57.990
Aakrsh: So,

345
00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.090
Brian Nguyen: Laws and methods that we use.

346
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.250
Brian Nguyen: Right in our program.

347
00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:08.880
Brian Nguyen: Will be approximating this component. And depending on our approximation.

348
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:11.340
Aakrsh: You know, some

349
00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:12.960
Brian Nguyen: Better you can approximate this

350
00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:14.880
Aakrsh: portion of your potential

351
00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:16.980
Brian Nguyen: On the day of your description of your

352
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:17.820
Overall,

353
00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.760
Aakrsh: Overall system right

354
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:23.100
Aakrsh: That makes sense. Guess.

355
00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:24.780
Brian Nguyen: This give me a nod.

356
00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:26.190
Brian Nguyen: All right.

357
00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.470
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so this is really bare

358
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.860
Aakrsh: Bones.

359
00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:30.810
Brian Nguyen: All right. Okay. So,

360
00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.370
Brian Nguyen: I'm going to save this material.

361
00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:37.320
Brian Nguyen: Here.

362
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:39.840
Brian Nguyen: I'm gonna move on. Anyone have questions.

363
00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:43.350
Brian Nguyen: Right, good. I'm clear, just

364
00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:46.950
Brian Nguyen: Clear my drawings. All right.

365
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.300
Brian Nguyen: So we

366
00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:49.800
Brian Nguyen: We are interested in

367
00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:52.770
Brian Nguyen: The total energy

368
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:54.330
Brian Nguyen: No grounds me energy

369
00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:02.160
Brian Nguyen: Right. So when you say grants the energy. We're looking for actually the lowest

370
00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:04.860
Brian Nguyen: Energy state.

371
00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:14.670
Brian Nguyen: For the molecules. Alright, see that, you know, makes sense rate for you're on the ground right in the very lowest point right so we always interested in that because

372
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:20.820
Brian Nguyen: molecules tend to be, you know, they like to be generally being the lowest state. I'm really

373
00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:21.570
Brian Nguyen: Interested in

374
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.590
Aakrsh: Finding that state.

375
00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.320
Brian Nguyen: So one way we can think about this.

376
00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:30.000
Brian Nguyen: Think of this on an empty.

377
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.670
Aakrsh: Is why

378
00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.260
Brian Nguyen: Does this affect okay let's draw a function that's very

379
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:51.180
Brian Nguyen: Easy to think about. Right.

380
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.160
Brian Nguyen: The assumption. A drawl is

381
00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:54.390
Aware.

382
00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:57.990
Brian Nguyen: All right.

383
00:26:58.410 --> 00:26:59.520
Brian Nguyen: And we then imagine

384
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:08.520
Brian Nguyen: At each of these points each of these points is some configuration of your molecule. Okay.

385
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.070
Brian Nguyen: So at the lowest point

386
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.080
Brian Nguyen: Is right here.

387
00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.120
Brian Nguyen: Is your lowest point

388
00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:17.970
Brian Nguyen: Call that the lowest point

389
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.550
Brian Nguyen: Will

390
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:22.620
Brian Nguyen: Will actually will

391
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:23.190
I

392
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:25.830
Brian Nguyen: Were labeled the

393
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:26.820
Y Ashley's

394
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:35.370
Brian Nguyen: Labeled the Y axes as energy. Okay.

395
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.850
Brian Nguyen: We can imagine this as

396
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:41.070
Brian Nguyen: X is the distance

397
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:43.560
Brian Nguyen: So it's a simple molecule.

398
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:46.140
Brian Nguyen: So simple molecules can common

399
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.060
Brian Nguyen: Common mine is the hydrogen atom.

400
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:49.170
Aakrsh: Right.

401
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:50.400
The hydrogen

402
00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:59.010
Brian Nguyen: Alright, and what we were going to adjust

403
00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:01.080
Brian Nguyen: His

404
00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:03.540
Brian Nguyen: Distance.

405
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.280
Brian Nguyen: In Tinder hydrogen atom x

406
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.950
Brian Nguyen: Now I should probably shifted a little bit

407
00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:16.920
Brian Nguyen: To make it a little bit more

408
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.380
Brian Nguyen: more reasonable.

409
00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:40.800
Aakrsh: Okay.

410
00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:42.420
Aakrsh: Alright.

411
00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.110
Aakrsh: If you're shifting it should be.

412
00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:55.140
Jeffrey Tsai: X minus c squared x squared plus c.

413
00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:58.170
Yeah.

414
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:04.800
Brian Nguyen: My

415
00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:16.560
Brian Nguyen: Yeah.

416
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:23.340
Brian Nguyen: Okay, anyways, I think I have a CZ myself. Okay.

417
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.440
Brian Nguyen: To get it. Okay. So, all right. I just want a simple example.

418
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:33.120
Brian Nguyen: Show you. Hey,

419
00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:41.580
Brian Nguyen: So we're interested in the lowest point of dysfunction. Right. And we're interested in finding that crown state.

420
00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.990
Brian Nguyen: Energy. Okay.

421
00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:44.670
Brian Nguyen: That's why we've been trying to

422
00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:45.660
All right.

423
00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.540
Brian Nguyen: One last thing is

424
00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:48.930
That

425
00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:51.450
Brian Nguyen: We once we get that

426
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:52.590
Brian Nguyen: Ground to the energy

427
00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:55.890
Brian Nguyen: From our calculation. How do we verify that is

428
00:29:57.570 --> 00:29:59.040
Brian Nguyen: If you go back to calculus.

429
00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:01.470
Brian Nguyen: What's the

430
00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:04.470
Brian Nguyen: What's the way I think you guys have taken calculus grip.

431
00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:07.740
Aakrsh: On appreciate

432
00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:08.820
Brian Nguyen: Fish, we take

433
00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:09.060
It.

434
00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:11.070
Aakrsh: Yeah.

435
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.760
Brian Nguyen: I'm

436
00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.530
Brian Nguyen: Okay then, Chris. I'll ask you this question.

437
00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:16.320
Brian Nguyen: How do you find

438
00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:17.490
Brian Nguyen: So,

439
00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:18.630
Brian Nguyen: How do you find the minimal

440
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:21.600
Brian Nguyen: A problem.

441
00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:26.970
Aakrsh: So you can take the derivative of is to find the slope of the

442
00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:32.280
Aakrsh: Very finding a minimal. Yeah.

443
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:34.290
Aakrsh: It's when the

444
00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:37.320
Aakrsh: Slope of the derivative is zero. Yeah, correct.

445
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:39.090
Brian Nguyen: Yep. Okay. So,

446
00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:41.910
Brian Nguyen: So we can go back to

447
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.020
Brian Nguyen: What is the derivative

448
00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:46.320
Brian Nguyen: We went away, we can think about it is essentially finding a slope.

449
00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:47.400
Aakrsh: So an example.

450
00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:48.690
Brian Nguyen: Is like a line.

451
00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:51.450
Brian Nguyen: Right, so each point here.

452
00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.890
Brian Nguyen: We case we want to find an instantaneous

453
00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:56.280
Aakrsh: Spoke

454
00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:58.020
Brian Nguyen: I spoke at that point.

455
00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:01.680
Brian Nguyen: All right, and delay to get that if you want to

456
00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.800
Brian Nguyen: So the line you need two points.

457
00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:06.600
Brian Nguyen: Correct. So you want to pick

458
00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:07.440
Aakrsh: Two points.

459
00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:09.180
Brian Nguyen: Are very, very close

460
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:16.110
Brian Nguyen: To that point of interest and kind of confused to compute the approximate line.

461
00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:17.730
Aakrsh: For that

462
00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:22.920
Brian Nguyen: All right. And you guys you get smaller want to get as close as you can I give you this

463
00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:23.730
Brian Nguyen: Overall scope.

464
00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:24.510
Brian Nguyen: At that point,

465
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:30.180
Brian Nguyen: All right, you can see that this is not to let you go down for them.

466
00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:32.310
Brian Nguyen: To this one right here, there is a point

467
00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:33.360
Brian Nguyen: On the curve.

468
00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:34.650
Brian Nguyen: Where this

469
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:36.720
Brian Nguyen: Slope. Overall, the

470
00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:39.420
Brian Nguyen: Euro.

471
00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:41.430
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

472
00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:42.990
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

473
00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:47.460
Brian Nguyen: So that's kind of kind of work from

474
00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.530
Brian Nguyen: From from algebra.

475
00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:53.820
Brian Nguyen: All right. Okay. So we'll have a way to

476
00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:54.900
Aakrsh: Kind of verify that

477
00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:55.800
All right.

478
00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:01.140
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so I say that's the introduction. I want to share to you guys about

479
00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:12.450
Brian Nguyen: Quantum Chemistry. So it's running to give you guys an idea of kind of what's happening. And then now we're going to explore pretty much

480
00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:14.820
Brian Nguyen: For the

481
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:17.310
Brian Nguyen: Company selected.

482
00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:18.990
Brian Nguyen: And accuracy is measured

483
00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:23.250
Brian Nguyen: Right. Okay. Let me save this.

484
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:25.020
Brian Nguyen: Right.

485
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.390
Brian Nguyen: Any last questions.

486
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.170
Brian Nguyen: Before I move on.

487
00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:29.550
Brian Nguyen: This is a lot

488
00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:31.890
Brian Nguyen: Of our new the information that you guys

489
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:34.560
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

490
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.030
Aakrsh: See you guys.

491
00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:38.220
Brian Nguyen: Got this great we're gonna move on.

492
00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:44.340
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so, then we'll go to my terminal.

493
00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:50.820
Brian Nguyen: Go.

494
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.280
Aakrsh: Go to the folder.

495
00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:58.290
Yes, I do.

496
00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:00.540
Theresa Carlos: I do

497
00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:11.520
Brian Nguyen: You want to save your near molecule.

498
00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:13.440
Brian Nguyen: Into the folder.

499
00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:15.570
Brian Nguyen: That he created

500
00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:17.550
Brian Nguyen: And once you

501
00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.610
Brian Nguyen: Remember how to read

502
00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:22.260
Brian Nguyen: To go to go to your

503
00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:22.980
Terminal

504
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:25.230
Aakrsh: All right.

505
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:29.100
Brian Nguyen: Can you share screen. Just make sure sure your terminal.

506
00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:33.360
Aakrsh: Quickly. All right.

507
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:38.130
Okay.

508
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.550
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so the

509
00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:44.940
Aakrsh: Mouth.

510
00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:56.340
Jeffrey Tsai: CD.

511
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.920
Aakrsh: CD.

512
00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:05.580
Brian Nguyen: DVD space.

513
00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:07.140
Aakrsh: For slash

514
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:07.560
Now,

515
00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:15.600

Brian Nguyen: And then we'll put the IP address.

626
00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.070
Brian Nguyen: And luckily, we can we name our IP address.

627
00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:07.050
Brian Nguyen: Based on just names of our computers.

628
00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:10.290
Brian Nguyen: Right, so I have my computer. It's called New York

629
00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:11.040
Okay.

630
00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.130
Brian Nguyen: All right, that's P. S.

631
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:15.120
Brian Nguyen: Is the

632
00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:18.210
Brian Nguyen: Physical Sciences that you

633
00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:19.830
Brian Nguyen: Were not done there.

634
00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:21.360
Brian Nguyen: We need to

635
00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:22.350
Aakrsh: Do a colon.

636
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.460
Brian Nguyen: So, this is this

637
00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:25.530
Brian Nguyen: Allows you to log into this computer.

638
00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.260

Brian Nguyen: All right, what

640
00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:34.050
Aakrsh: Question, how do we know what our computers.

641
00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:41.580
Brian Nguyen: So the way the Malian facility works is that it all. It's all latest server.

642
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:43.770
Brian Nguyen: So it doesn't matter what computer

654
00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:20.760
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so

655
00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.690
Brian Nguyen: I know the air. This is a very common era.

656
00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:28.260

Brian Nguyen: I've made in the past, but you get these kids.

659
00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.630
Brian Nguyen: So what happened is that

660
00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.280
Brian Nguyen: Remember when I said

661
00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:37.530

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.900
Brian Nguyen: A folder. Right.

666
00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:53.760
Brian Nguyen: To copy that file or that whole folder.

667
00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:59.160
Brian Nguyen: You have to add an extra option in front of Sep is called dash or

668
00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:01.080
Brian Nguyen: Does that sound familiar

669
00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:02.310
Or Monday.

670
00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:05.850
Brian Nguyen: Okay, sounds familiar for you guys.

671
00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:06.810

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:17.460
Brian Nguyen: All right.

677
00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.480
Brian Nguyen: So basically I went over an example.

678
00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:31.620
Brian Nguyen: Where like you might have an issue, right. Do not panic.

679
00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:34.560
Brian Nguyen: You know, try to read what the air is

680
00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:36.780
Brian Nguyen: Reading What happened.

681
00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.060
Brian Nguyen: Or Google stuff by my quarters.

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:39.690
Aakrsh: On coffee.

683
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:41.880
Brian Nguyen: Things like that, you'll find your answer.

684
00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:46.830
Brian Nguyen: Tonight, you know that the molecule has been transferred over

685
00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:50.100
Brian Nguyen: I want to ask you a minute.

686
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:52.380
Brian Nguyen: Ask you guys to transfer over your file.

687
00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:53.850
Does that work for you guys.

688
00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:02.130
Brian Nguyen: I remember

Brian Nguyen: I can try doing model.

884
00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:40.470
Brian Nguyen: For five or seven very

885
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:43.350
Brian Nguyen: Good. All right.

886
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:46.950
Brian Nguyen: Everyone caught that will move on.

887
00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:49.920
Brian Nguyen: Whatever you do,

888
00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:56.010
Brian Nguyen: Right now is to never run your calculation in your home directory, because that's

889
00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.950
Aakrsh: Connected to the server. All right, to

890
00:53:58.980 --> 00:53:59.760
Brian Nguyen: local server.

891
00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:01.890
Brian Nguyen: To our group.

892
00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:05.610
Brian Nguyen: And you run a calculation on a server, it will slow down, everyone.

893
00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:07.380
Brian Nguyen: Exit. Okay.

894
00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:09.180
Brian Nguyen: So we're always going to be running

895
00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:10.200
Aakrsh: Our calculation.

896
00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:11.670
Brian Nguyen: In this folder.

897
00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:13.950
Brian Nguyen: So CD for smash work.

898
00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:17.460
Brian Nguyen: Okay, you ll

899
00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:20.130

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:21.540
Brian Nguyen: Will see a bunch of music.

901
00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:22.800
Brian Nguyen: Would be the journey.

902
00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:24.780
Brian Nguyen: Makes your own directory

903
00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:28.260
Brian Nguyen: Yeah.

904
00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:30.090
Aakrsh: Let me

906
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:39.930
Aakrsh: Yeah, with market. So I just tried it again and tigers mean said denied, but it works for model for

907
00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:42.780
Brian Nguyen: OK, so maybe I think there's

908
00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:44.370
Aakrsh: Not that right name or something.

909
00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:46.950
Brian Nguyen: I don't know what happened. I'll figure out

910
00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:48.480
Brian Nguyen: For next year. All right. Thank you.

911
00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:50.670

00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:55.050
Brian Nguyen: Go into CD for smash.

914
00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:55.470
Brian Nguyen: Work.

915
00:54:56.130 --> 00:55:00.840
Brian Nguyen: For sash work is essentially the where you want to run all your calculation.

916
00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:03.720
Brian Nguyen: That's basically where it's going to save all your data.

917
00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:04.800
Aakrsh: On to that computer

918
00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:05.280
Aakrsh: Is so

919
00:55:05.730 --> 00:55:08.070
Brian Nguyen: Okay. Okay, watch easy

920
00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:09.570
Aakrsh: So, okay.

921
00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:14.130
Brian Nguyen: Never run your calculation your home directory or slows down three one else

922
00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:14.940
Brian Nguyen: Yep. Okay.

923
00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:16.230
Theresa Carlos: What did you

924
00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:18.840
Theresa Carlos: Have for because I can only see

925
00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:22.350
Theresa Carlos: I can't see any goes

926
00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:25.260
Brian Nguyen: Up for

927
00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:26.280
Work.

928
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:31.050
Aakrsh: Yeah, I can't see you.

929
00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:31.200
Can

930
00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:33.330
Brian Nguyen: Press Enter.

931
00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:41.460
Brian Nguyen: Yes. Okay, good Ls and there might be some user there. Maybe not. Who knows.

932
00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:44.700
Brian Nguyen: What we're gonna do is make your own directory India.

933
00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:46.620
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

934
00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.620
Brian Nguyen: And once you go into that directory

935
00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:52.860
Aakrsh: Alright.

936
00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.850
Brian Nguyen: Well for me, I have a bunch of

937
00:55:56.850 --> 00:55:57.450
Aakrsh: Things in there.

938
00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:58.980
Brian Nguyen: All right, what we can do is

939
00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:00.810
Brian Nguyen: We're going to move and the

940
00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:06.060
Brian Nguyen: Move that file called geo all ok so the way this work.

941
00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:06.840
Brian Nguyen: Is that

942
00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:09.720
Brian Nguyen: Another noticing them include this is

943
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:12.060
Brian Nguyen: We want to specify the pack.

944
00:56:13.290 --> 00:56:21.570
Brian Nguyen: File. Alright, the password that file is located. So this is another way of thinking it right in the past, we always have been moved at file.

945
00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:23.310
Brian Nguyen: In our current directory

946
00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:24.210
Brian Nguyen: I just file.

947
00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.320
Brian Nguyen: Something like that. Right.

948
00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:27.570
Brian Nguyen: So why are we kind of

949
00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:28.950
Brian Nguyen: Make a little bit more general.

950
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:30.060
Brian Nguyen: Or generalize this

951
00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:36.660
Brian Nguyen: Is called it the path file. Okay, we want to specify the destination. Our second option.

952
00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:38.310
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

953
00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:39.660
So,

954
00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:46.110
Brian Nguyen: What I do is I know that my file is in the home directory

955
00:56:46.650 --> 00:56:49.530
Brian Nguyen: To specified home directory. Press the tilda button.

956
00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:54.600
Brian Nguyen: Tilda. Tilda right somewhere on your keyboard and it will

957
00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:55.080
Brian Nguyen: Be ugly.

958
00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:56.610
Aakrsh: Right.

959
00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:57.600
Brian Nguyen: For smash.

960
00:56:58.230 --> 00:57:00.210
Brian Nguyen: If we press Tab, a couple of times.

961
00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:03.960
Brian Nguyen: Have too many more stuff but

962
00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:09.690
Brian Nguyen: I too many files but getting really easy search through it is the file is in there.

963
00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.370
Brian Nguyen: Call God

964
00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:13.050
Aakrsh: ever interested. Right.

965
00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:14.430
Brian Nguyen: Here that

966
00:57:15.330 --> 00:57:15.870
Brian Nguyen: You up

967
00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:17.250
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

968
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:20.730
Brian Nguyen: The tab is a way to preview what's what's in that folder.

969
00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:22.380
Brian Nguyen: And then type in geo off.

970
00:57:23.970 --> 00:57:27.690
Brian Nguyen: And when when you throw away trying to avoid an error.

971
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:29.970
Brian Nguyen: Is typing for specific couple first

972
00:57:29.970 --> 00:57:31.800
Brian Nguyen: Few letters and in pressing Tab.

973
00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:32.430
Brian Nguyen: It will

974
00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:33.930
Brian Nguyen: Basically auto complete free

975
00:57:35.130 --> 00:57:36.870
Brian Nguyen: Alright, have all the file with

976
00:57:37.410 --> 00:57:39.450
Aakrsh: You know, similar characters.

977
00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:41.220
Theresa Carlos: Okay, Jason.

978
00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:45.090
Brian Nguyen: Hi, Jason.

979

Aakrsh: Yes.

981
00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:54.690
Aakrsh: So what I did was here.

982
00:57:55.170 --> 00:57:56.850
Brian Nguyen: I'm going to generalize the

983
00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:58.230
Brian Nguyen: Command move

984
00:57:58.380 --> 00:57:59.940
Brian Nguyen: It is very similar to CP

985
00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:01.380
Brian Nguyen: And all that and sec

986
00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:03.900
Brian Nguyen: The generalized

987
00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:06.570
Brian Nguyen: Generally what I wrote here with file.

988
00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:09.960
Brian Nguyen: And that file is you works when you're in the current

989
00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:11.580
Brian Nguyen: Directory. Right.

990
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:18.750
Brian Nguyen: And I'm going to specify the destination someone generalize it by saying that we're trying to look for the path.

991
00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:19.980
Brian Nguyen: Of where the file is

992
00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:21.120
Okay.

993
00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:24.120

00:59:45.150 --> 00:59:47.100
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so if you save

1033
00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:49.890
Brian Nguyen: This file in this a New York

1034
00:59:50.610 --> 00:59:53.760
Brian Nguyen: And if you go to model for and try to look for that file.

1035
00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:54.480
Aakrsh: In the work

1036
00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:55.470
Brian Nguyen: It's not there.

1037
00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:57.510
Brian Nguyen: Because it's actually physically save

00:59:57.570 --> 00:59:58.590
Aakrsh: On that directory

1039
00:59:59.250 --> 01:00:00.330
Brian Nguyen: So what you need to do is you

1040
01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.920
Brian Nguyen: Need to copy that file.

1041
01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:02.550
Brian Nguyen: Back to

1042
01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:03.750
Your home directory

1043
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:05.370
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1044
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.780
Aakrsh: Because all computers will access your home directory and

1045
01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.900
Brian Nguyen: That's the only thing that's common alright so just keep that in mind. If

1046
01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:16.560
Brian Nguyen: You say you can't find the file, you know, what's happening is that the

1047
01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:19.320
Aakrsh: Best. All right.

1048
01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:20.220
Aakrsh: So,

1049
01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:23.250
Brian Nguyen: Here's the file water dot x, y, z.

1050
01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:25.320
Aakrsh: Right, so

1051
01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:26.070
Aakrsh: Let's try to

1052
01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:27.690
Brian Nguyen: Look into the file.

1053
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:34.560
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so as soon as I text editor. So do you guys remember what's at the editor that we talked about on Monday.

1054
01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:37.320
Aakrsh: Of VI. Yes.

1055
01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:38.790
Aakrsh: He is our

1056
01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:40.680
Brian Nguyen: VR to water.

1057
01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:42.660
Aakrsh: All right.

1058
01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:43.800
Brian Nguyen: Let's look into that file.

1059
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:49.170
Brian Nguyen: See what it is before actually starting to calculation.

1060
01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:50.700
Brian Nguyen: Because we need to kind of understand what's

1061
01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.020
Brian Nguyen: Happening right

1062
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:54.900
Brian Nguyen: To keep taking a little while for me.

1063
01:00:57.930 --> 01:01:00.990
Brian Nguyen: But what do you get to see a the first line.

1064
01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:02.580
Aakrsh: In your file should be

1065
01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:03.720
Brian Nguyen: The number of molecules.

1066
01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:04.590
Aakrsh: I mean,

1067
01:01:04.830 --> 01:01:05.580
Brian Nguyen: Now we're at them.

1068
01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:10.530
Brian Nguyen: Now we're atoms in the next few lines.

1069
01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:12.240
Brian Nguyen: Are the coordinates.

1070
01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:12.780
Brian Nguyen: For

1071
01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:14.190
Brian Nguyen: Each of your Adam

1072
01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.140
Aakrsh: Says x

1073
01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:18.000
Brian Nguyen: Y and Z.

1074
01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:20.550
Brian Nguyen: And these guys are all in

1075
01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:21.240
Brian Nguyen: A strong

1076
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:26.460
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so it's good to now be familiar. What's the, what's the, what's the what's in

1077
01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:27.600
It.

1078
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:30.090
Brian Nguyen: And it's quick.

1079
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:33.000
Aakrsh: Alright.

1080
01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:35.100
Brian Nguyen: Colin. Just remember that.

1081
01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:36.840
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1082
01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:39.030
Brian Nguyen: So here's the next thing that we're going to need to do

1083
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:41.610
Aakrsh: We need to load.

1084
01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.160
Brian Nguyen: In the turbo program.

1085
01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:45.390
Aakrsh: Or increase Peter

1086
01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:48.600
Brian Nguyen: And the command for that is module.

1087
01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:50.490
Aakrsh: Load

1088
01:01:58.110 --> 01:02:00.090
Brian Nguyen: How do we know that the module is loaded

1089
01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:02.790
Brian Nguyen: Into typing module list.

1090
01:02:04.410 --> 01:02:06.120
Brian Nguyen: And usually see your terrible more

1091
01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:07.050
Programming.

1092
01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:09.600
Aakrsh: Okay.

1093
01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.700
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so we're moving on to our next step.

1094
01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:17.640
Brian Nguyen: We're once we load our program.

1095
01:02:18.270 --> 01:02:20.400
Brian Nguyen: We are now going to

1096
01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:21.870
Convert

1097
01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:25.590
Aakrsh: This version of the file.

1098
01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:26.760
Brian Nguyen: Is XYZ

1099
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:29.820
Aakrsh: Into a format that several more can read

1100
01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:33.270
Brian Nguyen: Okay, and the command for that is to keep

1101
01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:35.520
Brian Nguyen: Water

1102
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:41.460
Brian Nguyen: Great, great. And symbol.

1103
01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:49.560
Brian Nguyen: And we're going to type this file, you can name it any file you want, but the most simplest file.

1104
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:50.400
Brian Nguyen: You can name it.

1105
01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:51.390
Brian Nguyen: Is called cord.

1106
01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.040
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1107
01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:55.020
Brian Nguyen: This is kind of much, much easier.

1108
01:02:55.530 --> 01:02:57.930
Brian Nguyen: It doesn't matter. You can name it. Anything you want. All right.

1109
01:02:59.160 --> 01:02:59.460
Brian Nguyen: And

1110
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:06.360
Aakrsh: And that makes it like you can actually do to remove. Yes. Yeah.

1111
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:11.820
Brian Nguyen: To remote then can read this file. Okay. It's a format a terminal to read and so

1112
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:14.070
Brian Nguyen: To kind of understand what that formatting is

1113
01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:15.060
Aakrsh: This look

1114
01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.280
Brian Nguyen: Into the core file itself.

1115
01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.560
Brian Nguyen: Right, the cord.

1116
01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:25.050
Brian Nguyen: You see that there's slightly different

1117
01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:26.670
Brian Nguyen: Right format is slightly there.

1118
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:28.920
Brian Nguyen: Certain right the atoms on the right side.

1119
01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:32.400
Brian Nguyen: The corners or x, y, z. So, the same

1120
01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:35.130
Brian Nguyen: But we have this dollar sign

1121
01:03:35.310 --> 01:03:36.180
Brian Nguyen: gorge indulge

1122
01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:36.810
Aakrsh: In

1123
01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:38.700
Brian Nguyen: Its going to indicate

1124
01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:40.680
Aakrsh: Have to

1125
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:41.850
Brian Nguyen: Indicate reading the

1126
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:42.870
Brian Nguyen: Reading the file.

1127
01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:47.760
Brian Nguyen: He's a nerd at the numbers is slightly different.

1128
01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:49.380
Aakrsh: From the XYZ coordinate

1129
01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:51.330
Brian Nguyen: Is because it's in a different unit.

1130
01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.850
Brian Nguyen: Right. Yes, he is called

1131
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:54.780
Brian Nguyen: A comic minutes

1132
01:03:55.770 --> 01:03:56.520
Brian Nguyen: All right, as

1133
01:03:56.850 --> 01:03:58.470
Brian Nguyen: Are compensated. Okay.

1134
01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:01.200
Aakrsh: So, don't, don't worry about that too much.

1135
01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:04.560
Brian Nguyen: But the thing is that we use a comment units.

1136
01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:09.120
Brian Nguyen: We can run a calculation, a little bit easier.

1137
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:12.690
Brian Nguyen: And because there's no there's no there's no. All right.

1138
01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:17.760
Brian Nguyen: We don't have to worry too much about the music.

1139
01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:19.650
Brian Nguyen: They are

1140
01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.800
Brian Nguyen: Doing some conversion factors. Alright.

1141
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:24.840
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so once you get that

1142
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:29.220
Brian Nguyen: We then need to prepare outcomes.

1143
01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:32.700
Theresa Carlos: Mention me

1144
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:38.550
Brian Nguyen: Finish up to you. Alright so next Teresa share me your screen.

1145
01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:41.610
Brian Nguyen: Why are we doing that.

1146
01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:42.810
Aakrsh: Time Victoria.

1147
01:04:42.930 --> 01:04:46.470
Aakrsh: A Christian got this yeah he

1148
01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:49.830
Brian Nguyen: Actually sent me your screen.

1149
01:05:04.110 --> 01:05:07.050
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so what happened here is that

1150
01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:10.230
Brian Nguyen: You have we wanted to move

1151
01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:16.890
Brian Nguyen: The file. Okay, so if you look up the second line from the top.

1152
01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:21.150
Brian Nguyen: And the soda God

1153
01:05:22.590 --> 01:05:24.600
Brian Nguyen: So read the next line.

1154
01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:25.980
Brian Nguyen: What does that say

1155
01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:34.620
Brian Nguyen: That, that means that you didn't type in the file. Correct. Okay.

1156
01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:37.140
Brian Nguyen: So you missing some

1157
01:05:37.650 --> 01:05:41.100
Brian Nguyen: Names. Okay, so let's try again.

1158
01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:42.750
Brian Nguyen: You envy.

1159
01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:46.110
Brian Nguyen: Tilda.

1160
01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:47.880
Brian Nguyen: For smash.

1161
01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:49.200
Brian Nguyen: You

1162
01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:49.860
Are people

1163
01:05:57.930 --> 01:05:59.340
Brian Nguyen: Oh, yeah.

1164
01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:01.440
Brian Nguyen: There we go. There's the file a

1165
01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:02.040
State.

1166
01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:06.270
Brian Nguyen: That's what you want to save it in

1167
01:06:07.410 --> 01:06:07.830
Brian Nguyen: A move it.

1168
01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:08.700
Aakrsh: To the file.

1169
01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:10.500
Brian Nguyen: And these get

1170
01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:12.030
Brian Nguyen: Ls

1171
01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:34.200
Brian Nguyen: Okay, good.

1172
01:06:39.930 --> 01:06:40.170
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1173
01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.010
Brian Nguyen: Now you can see all that right so now we're going to

1174
01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.000
Brian Nguyen: Execute to

1175
01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:48.540
Aakrsh: Face.

1176
01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:49.680
Water

1177
01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:53.460
Brian Nguyen: Xyz

1178
01:06:55.050 --> 01:06:56.730
Brian Nguyen: And greater than

1179
01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:58.350
Court

1180
01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:02.190
Brian Nguyen: Alright everyone,

1181
01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.310
Brian Nguyen: So you see, I've been troubleshooting.

1182
01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:09.210
Brian Nguyen: With you guys right you see this a couple of times. Right, so

1183
01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:20.190
Brian Nguyen: Maybe next time, if one of you guys have a problem on our open this up to the floor and ask you guys what could be the issue. All right. Okay.

1184
01:07:20.490 --> 01:07:22.200
Brian Nguyen: So if you just cut the cord file.

1185
01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:23.010
Brian Nguyen: The court.

1186
01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:25.470
Brian Nguyen: Will see or hear everything here.

1187
01:07:27.030 --> 01:07:27.270
Brian Nguyen: Soon.

1188
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:30.570
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so our

1189
01:07:31.290 --> 01:07:35.040
Aakrsh: Our corners are a little bit different. Okay. Alright, so now

1190
01:07:35.070 --> 01:07:36.660
Brian Nguyen: As quick is

1191
01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:38.370
Aakrsh: All right.

1192
01:07:38.790 --> 01:07:39.990
Brian Nguyen: stop sharing your screen.

1193
01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:45.000
Brian Nguyen: Oh, right. So,

1194
01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:47.850
Brian Nguyen: We have our x, y, z coordinate

1195
01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:50.310
Brian Nguyen: We need to now.

1196
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:55.050
Brian Nguyen: What we can pass. Think of this

1197
01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:58.680
Brian Nguyen: As analogous to is like the the pre lab.

1198
01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:00.990
Aakrsh: We do run it when you do an experiment.

1199
01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:04.560
Brian Nguyen: You got to prepare your, your do some prep work.

1200
01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:07.320
Brian Nguyen: Right so equivalent to this is we need to do some

1201
01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.180
Brian Nguyen: prep work before actually line up.

1202
01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:14.700
Brian Nguyen: Right, and so that prep work means that we need to think about

1203
01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:14.970
This

1204
01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:18.870
Brian Nguyen: On a subatomic level. All right.

1205
01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:20.730
Brian Nguyen: So remember when I was

1206
01:08:20.850 --> 01:08:23.880
Brian Nguyen: First purchase purchase this picture. I said, How did you get the energy

1207
01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:24.930
Brian Nguyen: Right, if you just

1208
01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:26.370
Brian Nguyen: Given XYZ coordinates.

1209
01:08:27.210 --> 01:08:27.510
Aakrsh: All right.

1210
01:08:27.810 --> 01:08:28.770
Brian Nguyen: We need to

1211
01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.190
Brian Nguyen: Okay, from the electronic structure method.

1212
01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:34.950
Brian Nguyen: And the way we want to do it.

1213
01:08:35.190 --> 01:08:36.750
Brian Nguyen: Is by generating

1214
01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:38.970
Brian Nguyen: Molecular orbital.

1215
01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:41.640
Aakrsh: Okay.

1216
01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:43.860
Brian Nguyen: Guys know what a molecular over those are

1217
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:45.180
Brian Nguyen: Good ideas.

1218
01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:48.750
Brian Nguyen: I know how, but the courts and your

1219
01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:51.510
Brian Nguyen: Molecular over those are good.

1220
01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:53.910
Brian Nguyen: Chris Evans get get

1221
01:08:53.970 --> 01:08:54.210
Get

1222
01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:59.460
Brian Nguyen: What we need to do is we need to generate those molecular orbital. Right.

1223
01:09:00.690 --> 01:09:02.520
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so think goes over those

1224
01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.670
Brian Nguyen: Are a description of the electron.

1225
01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.330
Brian Nguyen: Generate that we're going to use a command called define

1226
01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:14.790
Brian Nguyen: It's a little script. Okay.

1227
01:09:15.270 --> 01:09:16.800
Brian Nguyen: No GJ careful

1228
01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:20.910
Brian Nguyen: Take a lot of notes, there's gonna be a lot of options in here.

1229
01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.980
Brian Nguyen: Okay, I was pinpoint to do some of the

1230
01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:26.010
Brian Nguyen: Interest the options that were interested in

1231
01:09:26.370 --> 01:09:29.400
Brian Nguyen: Right. But it's like okay, Enter.

1232
01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:32.250
Brian Nguyen: All right, what happened here.

1233
01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:34.560
Brian Nguyen: Open up terminal.

1234
01:09:34.890 --> 01:09:35.970
Brian Nguyen: I'll be up to the library.

1235
01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:39.210
Aakrsh: Okay, opens up the program called terminal. Terminal

1236
01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:39.870
Define

1237
01:09:41.790 --> 01:09:46.080
Brian Nguyen: Alright so this one, do you want to do something different, just

1238
01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:49.560
Brian Nguyen: This press enter. Ignore that you want to put a title.

1239
01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:53.460
Brian Nguyen: It's okay, it's not really needed was entered. All right.

1240
01:09:53.550 --> 01:09:54.750
Brian Nguyen: Now you're here.

1241
01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:56.760
Brian Nguyen: You're in this window here.

1242
01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:58.410
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

1243
01:09:59.370 --> 01:10:01.740
Brian Nguyen: We're specifying them like john adams

1244
01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:02.640
Aakrsh: Cemetery.

1245
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.140
Brian Nguyen: Where we're going to do is

1246
01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:06.060
Brian Nguyen: No specified items.

1247
01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:11.100
Aakrsh: To do that input our atoms. This command here.

1248
01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:15.000
Brian Nguyen: Alright we touched a

1249
01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:16.410
Chord

1250
01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.100
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so a chord.

1251
01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:23.760
Brian Nguyen: It could be any file, right. You just named it poured. Okay.

1252
01:10:24.090 --> 01:10:25.410
Brian Nguyen: As long as in the right format.

1253
01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:30.090
Brian Nguyen: Is correct. Now Adam

1254
01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.930
Curry.

1255
01:10:32.010 --> 01:10:36.030
Brian Nguyen: Okay, and then we want to type in one last thing is desi

1256
01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:40.590
Aakrsh: Okay. So notice that this will change a little bit.

1257
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:47.190
Brian Nguyen: Oh,

1258
01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:48.870
Brian Nguyen: Wow.

1259
01:10:50.010 --> 01:10:50.280
OK.

1260
01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.220
Brian Nguyen: OK. OK, so there it

1261
01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:58.920
Brian Nguyen: Is allows you to run your calculations take advantage of this imagery of your molecule.

1262
01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:02.070
Brian Nguyen: So you can really you want you can turn off symmetry.

1263
01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:04.380
Brian Nguyen: To make a calculation goes

1264
01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:04.860
Faster.

1265
01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:06.660
Brian Nguyen: Keep that in mind.

1266
01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:08.970
Aakrsh: Typing I read

1267
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:18.120
Victoria Choi: This one does. He was it just does he

1268
01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:19.560
Brian Nguyen: Yeah yeah

1269
01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:22.260
Aakrsh: Yeah.

1270
01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:29.280
Brian Nguyen: I think mine is kind of messed up, but that's

1271
01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:29.730
Okay.

1272
01:11:31.290 --> 01:11:34.050
Brian Nguyen: All right, this is all related to

1273
01:11:34.530 --> 01:11:36.330
Brian Nguyen: The top is called point symmetry.

1274
01:11:37.170 --> 01:11:37.530
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1275
01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.250
Aakrsh: So, this is this is

1276
01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:39.150
Brian Nguyen: A don't take it as it

1277
01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.670
Brian Nguyen: Is for you guys to know that you want to know.

1278
01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:42.690
Brian Nguyen: More information about

1279
01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:43.920
Brian Nguyen: This means

1280
01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:45.630
Brian Nguyen: Look up point cemetery.

1281
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:46.440
Aakrsh: Okay.

1282
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:47.670
Brian Nguyen: It is. It's pretty easy.

1283
01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:53.280
Brian Nguyen: You know, we can talk, talk about it more an office. Are you interested in. Okay.

1284
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.410
Aakrsh: All right.

1285
01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.330
Brian Nguyen: You want to type in, I read

1286
01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:01.380
Brian Nguyen: All right, I read is essentially

1287
01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:03.090
Brian Nguyen: It says right here.

1288
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:04.950
Brian Nguyen: Redundant internet coordinate

1289
01:12:07.050 --> 01:12:07.440
Aakrsh: Okay.

1290
01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:09.600
Brian Nguyen: And so what that means.

1291
01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:12.390
Brian Nguyen: Well, because this way.

1292
01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:14.580
Brian Nguyen: You have lot coordinate

1293
01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:15.960
Aakrsh: X, y, z.

1294
01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.170
Brian Nguyen: Right. Are you guys familiar with polar

1295
01:12:19.290 --> 01:12:19.770
Coordinates.

1296
01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:21.630
Aakrsh: Yeah.

1297
01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:23.130
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1298
01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:26.460
Brian Nguyen: Is and also have you heard of spiritual coordinates.

1299
01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:29.670
Aakrsh: Okay.

1300
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:32.790
Brian Nguyen: But how will you guys 37 Talia.

1301
01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:34.260
Brian Nguyen: On

1302
01:12:35.370 --> 01:12:37.710
Brian Nguyen: Is not know. Okay, so that's okay with

1303
01:12:39.690 --> 01:12:42.090
Brian Nguyen: Me stop for a little bit, so they can shoot

1304
01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:43.110
Brian Nguyen: Show you a little bit

1305
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.860
Aakrsh: When I

1306
01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:44.250
Mean

1307
01:12:47.670 --> 01:12:48.540
Aakrsh: He's a whiteboard.

1308
01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:49.770
Okay.

1309
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:52.290
Brian Nguyen: He cleared this

1310
01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:54.630
Brian Nguyen: Drawing

1311
01:13:02.730 --> 01:13:07.140
Brian Nguyen: Is your plot. Okay. And if you have a line.

1312
01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:07.830
To

1313
01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:14.460
Brian Nguyen: Where you want to hear your why

1314
01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:15.120
Brian Nguyen: Use your

1315
01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:18.360
Aakrsh: Okay, so

1316
01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:20.820
Brian Nguyen: They can this way, you want to figure out

1317
01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:21.810
Brian Nguyen: What this point is

1318
01:13:22.770 --> 01:13:24.810
Brian Nguyen: Like January, we can say

1319
01:13:24.930 --> 01:13:25.260
X.

1320
01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:27.030
Brian Nguyen: Y.

1321
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:28.110
Correct.

1322
01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:33.630
Aakrsh: Because that make sense yeah okay so

1323
01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:35.880
Brian Nguyen: Like changing different coordinate system.

1324
01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:36.510
Brian Nguyen: It just

1325
01:13:36.570 --> 01:13:38.130
Brian Nguyen: Essentially the same thing.

1326
01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:40.950
Brian Nguyen: But you want to find describe in a different way.

1327
01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:43.770
Brian Nguyen: Right through to this is what we call

1328
01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:44.610
Brian Nguyen: X, y, z.

1329
01:13:47.970 --> 01:13:51.000
Aakrsh: Or it's the same. It's called Cartesian coordinates.

1330
01:13:56.850 --> 01:13:57.210
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1331
01:13:58.410 --> 01:13:58.590
Brian Nguyen: We

1332
01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.420
Brian Nguyen: Say we want to describe it.

1333
01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.760
Brian Nguyen: Using polar coordinate right

1334
01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:05.040
Brian Nguyen: We can still describe the same point here.

1335
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.700
Brian Nguyen: But with a different flavor to it.

1336
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:11.460
Brian Nguyen: Right. So here you can imagine.

1337
01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:17.460
Brian Nguyen: There's an angle here. We'll call it data or I will not qualify

1338
01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:18.960
Brian Nguyen: Is an angle.

1339
01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:21.720
Brian Nguyen: And this point here.

1340
01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:25.260
Brian Nguyen: Is a distance are

1341
01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:27.090
Aakrsh: Okay.

1342
01:14:27.870 --> 01:14:29.670
Brian Nguyen: So we can describe this same point.

1343
01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.560
Brian Nguyen: By describing it by

1344
01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:32.700
Right car.

1345
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:34.110
Brian Nguyen: By

1346
01:14:39.150 --> 01:14:39.450
Aakrsh: Okay.

1347
01:14:39.630 --> 01:14:41.610
Brian Nguyen: Given an angel, and given the distance

1348
01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:44.910
Aakrsh: Are you can kind of describe the same

1349
01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:48.270
Aakrsh: Point. Okay. So essentially if

1350
01:14:48.330 --> 01:14:50.340
Brian Nguyen: You're just changing different

1351
01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:51.720
Aakrsh: Coordinate system.

1352
01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:56.220
Brian Nguyen: And oftentimes, changing different coordinate system.

1353
01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:57.660
Brian Nguyen: Can be a little bit easier.

1354
01:14:57.900 --> 01:14:59.400
Brian Nguyen: So sometimes it's easier to work in

1355
01:14:59.430 --> 01:15:01.440
Brian Nguyen: polar coordinate, this is what we call

1356
01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:09.690
Brian Nguyen: The polar coordinate

1357
01:15:10.290 --> 01:15:10.710
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1358
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:12.480
Brian Nguyen: Does that help

1359
01:15:15.690 --> 01:15:16.170
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1360
01:15:17.730 --> 01:15:19.590
Brian Nguyen: Stop share or share

1361
01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:20.250
Aakrsh: Or

1362
01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:21.840
Go back to here.

1363
01:15:23.070 --> 01:15:27.270
Brian Nguyen: So you want to Google, this, this is a different way.

1364
01:15:27.630 --> 01:15:30.930
Brian Nguyen: Of representing our coordinate it just makes that calculation.

1365
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:31.860
Aakrsh: Faster.

1366
01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:34.200
Brian Nguyen: All right. Always use it if you can.

1367
01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:37.290
Brian Nguyen: Okay. Alright, so now we're done.

1368
01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:39.840
Brian Nguyen: With our terminate this place.

1369
01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:46.980
Brian Nguyen: All right, now here in the window.

1370
01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:50.580
Brian Nguyen: We're called the basis

1371
01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:50.850
Set

1372
01:15:52.290 --> 01:15:52.680
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1373
01:15:53.370 --> 01:15:56.730
Brian Nguyen: This is related to linear algebra, kind of related to Algebra two

1374
01:15:59.190 --> 01:16:01.650
Brian Nguyen: Does anyone know what I wonder, I kind of opened this out.

1375
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:04.380
Brian Nguyen: Is anyone familiar with basis what

1376
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:06.300
Aakrsh: What's the basis that

1377
01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.340
Brian Nguyen: Yesterday. All right.

1378
01:16:13.230 --> 01:16:15.750
Brian Nguyen: Going back to a point, I'm going to explain all this

1379
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.530
Brian Nguyen: Very

1380
01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:18.510
Brian Nguyen: Very simple for you guys. Alright.

1381
01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.580
Brian Nguyen: So for basis sets.

1382
01:16:25.050 --> 01:16:26.310
Brian Nguyen: You guys some there with

1383
01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:27.060
Vectors.

1384
01:16:31.290 --> 01:16:31.770
Aakrsh: Right, good.

1385
01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:34.560
Brian Nguyen: Tanya gaudy Teresa a Christian on. Yes.

1386
01:16:34.650 --> 01:16:36.270
Brian Nguyen: Teresa Victoria.

1387
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:39.450
Aakrsh: Yes, yes, good good today. Good.

1388
01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:42.060
Brian Nguyen: To see y'all know was vector is

1389
01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:44.880
Brian Nguyen: Finished. So this basically here, you can think of.

1390
01:16:46.650 --> 01:16:46.890
Brian Nguyen: It.

1391
01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:48.930
Aakrsh: Because

1392
01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.210
Brian Nguyen: This thing here vector

1393
01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:54.870
Brian Nguyen: Okay, alright. So we have a vector.

1394
01:16:55.710 --> 01:16:56.250
Brian Nguyen: Will call

1395
01:16:56.370 --> 01:16:56.520
It.

1396
01:16:57.630 --> 01:16:58.410
Brian Nguyen: And why

1397
01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:04.320
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so a basis means that

1398
01:17:05.370 --> 01:17:06.030
Brian Nguyen: The set of

1399
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.810
Aakrsh: Set of

1400
01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:10.500
Vectors.

1401
01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:12.630
Brian Nguyen: Are independent

1402
01:17:12.690 --> 01:17:13.560
With each other.

1403
01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:19.110
Brian Nguyen: So an example.

1404
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:21.150
Brian Nguyen: Of a basis.

1405
01:17:22.410 --> 01:17:24.660
Brian Nguyen: I'll just kind of give you an example to see

1406
01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:27.630
Brian Nguyen: One euro.

1407
01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:32.460
Brian Nguyen: Euro one

1408
01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:36.330
Aakrsh: forms a basis.

1409
01:17:45.630 --> 01:17:48.390
Brian Nguyen: All right. And what I mean by this.

1410
01:17:48.810 --> 01:17:49.380
Brian Nguyen: Is that

1411
01:17:49.890 --> 01:17:51.000
Brian Nguyen: You can see that

1412
01:17:51.570 --> 01:17:55.050
Brian Nguyen: These two phases sets are independent of each other.

1413
01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:59.310
Brian Nguyen: That means that they can't, you can't multiply any number

1414
01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:00.090
Brian Nguyen: To make this

1415
01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:00.720
Aakrsh: Equivalent

1416
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.470
Aakrsh: All right.

1417
01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:03.690
Brian Nguyen: All right, and

1418
01:18:05.130 --> 01:18:06.720
Brian Nguyen: Basically, you can imagine.

1419
01:18:12.330 --> 01:18:17.940
Brian Nguyen: That this faces here x and y is general right can be described

1420
01:18:17.970 --> 01:18:18.810
Brian Nguyen: By your patients.

1421
01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:22.260
Brian Nguyen: By a number called

1422
01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:24.060
Brian Nguyen: A one.

1423
01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:27.570
Aakrsh: A one is a constant.

1424
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.260
But

1425
01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:30.900
Brian Nguyen: This

1426
01:18:37.050 --> 01:18:37.470
Brian Nguyen: Right.

1427
01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:42.780
Aakrsh: You're

1428
01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:47.640
Aakrsh: Right. Does that make sense.

1429
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:54.600
Brian Nguyen: So essentially you can describe ideas they describe your

1430
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:56.430
Brian Nguyen: X, y,

1431
01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:57.780
Aakrsh: Coordinate

1432
01:18:58.590 --> 01:18:59.700
With this set of basis.

1433
01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:01.380
Brian Nguyen: Any numbers.

1434
01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:03.660
We call it the linear combination

1435
01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:05.550
All right.

1436
01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:11.700
Aakrsh: All right.

1437
01:19:15.630 --> 01:19:16.530
Aakrsh: Does that make sense to the

1438
01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:17.520
Spaces.

1439
01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:20.100
Brian Nguyen: Right, so

1440
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:22.950
Brian Nguyen: So that's kind of essentially what ideas.

1441
01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:25.380
Brian Nguyen: Of basis. Okay, so our base is going to

1442
01:19:25.410 --> 01:19:26.400
Aakrsh: Be describing

1443
01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:29.130
Brian Nguyen: The electron for a given Adam

1444
01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:31.590
Aakrsh: All right. Okay.

1445
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.570
Save this

1446
01:19:35.730 --> 01:19:36.180
Aakrsh: Go back.

1447
01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:36.900
To here.

1448
01:19:40.590 --> 01:19:43.020
Brian Nguyen: Now if you again. If you guys want to go.

1449
01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:46.020
Brian Nguyen: Into office hours. I'll explain a little bit more wider basis.

1450
01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:47.760
Brian Nguyen: But that's kind of the general idea.

1451
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:50.520
Brian Nguyen: Here. Alright, so what we have here.

1452
01:19:51.450 --> 01:19:52.620
Brian Nguyen: Which we're going to list out

1453
01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:55.320
Brian Nguyen: All the bases head there are assigned to the atoms.

1454
01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:58.710
Brian Nguyen: Oxygen and hygiene.

1455
01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:00.570
Aakrsh: Right.

1456
01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:01.800
Brian Nguyen: Is called death.

1457
01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:04.110
Okay.

1458
01:20:05.250 --> 01:20:07.560
Aakrsh: We're going to use the basis hit call

1459
01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:09.510
Brian Nguyen: We're going to use this

1460
01:20:10.230 --> 01:20:11.430
Brian Nguyen: Command be

1461
01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:13.350
Brian Nguyen: Assigned comics basis.

1462
01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:15.510
Brian Nguyen: And we say all

1463
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:18.090
Brian Nguyen: That would be all with a sign all the atoms that

1464
01:20:18.150 --> 01:20:19.170
Aakrsh: To SVP

1465
01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:20.580
Aakrsh: Okay.

1466
01:20:20.610 --> 01:20:21.000
Enter.

1467
01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:23.160
Brian Nguyen: That should set up.

1468
01:20:23.370 --> 01:20:24.240
Brian Nguyen: You do the L.

1469
01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:25.740
Brian Nguyen: Me that is

1470
01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:26.940
Aakrsh: To STP.

1471
01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:31.650
Brian Nguyen: Right. Moving on.

1472
01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:35.280
Brian Nguyen: This car.

1473
01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:44.580
Brian Nguyen: Here, let's

1474
01:20:46.230 --> 01:20:46.680
Aakrsh: Go on.

1475
01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:49.380
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1476
01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:51.420
Victoria Choi: Yeah, this one.

1477
01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:52.950
Aakrsh: Assign the basis that

1478
01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:55.050
Brian Nguyen: There's a lot of babies that

1479
01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:56.220
Brian Nguyen: For now, we're gonna sign

1480
01:20:57.150 --> 01:20:58.530
Brian Nguyen: Up. Okay.

1481
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:06.450
Aakrsh: All right, we're good.

1482
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:07.890
Aakrsh: All right.

1483
01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:08.880
Brian Nguyen: Good star.

1484
01:21:10.170 --> 01:21:11.520
Brian Nguyen: Right now we go into this window.

1485
01:21:12.930 --> 01:21:15.690
Brian Nguyen: Where we. There are many ways of generating our orbitals.

1486
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:16.110
Aakrsh: Let go.

1487
01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:16.470
Brian Nguyen: Over to

1488
01:21:17.490 --> 01:21:20.640
Brian Nguyen: The one we're going to use this one, he, he

1489
01:21:21.690 --> 01:21:22.170
Brian Nguyen: Called

1490
01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:25.680
Brian Nguyen: Coco guess. Okay. This will generate our orbital.

1491
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:27.180
Our initial gets

1492
01:21:28.230 --> 01:21:30.180
Brian Nguyen: All right, and so

1493
01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:35.580
Aakrsh: I won't go into detail. How does it say generation orbital. Alright, so it's a

1494
01:21:35.730 --> 01:21:36.390
Aakrsh: PhD.

1495
01:21:37.050 --> 01:21:39.030
Brian Nguyen: And turn off.

1496
01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:40.950
Aakrsh: Some stuff.

1497
01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:42.090
Brian Nguyen: Read some stuff right

1498
01:21:42.150 --> 01:21:42.690
Aakrsh: It says

1499
01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:43.890
Aakrsh: You want to use extended

1500
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:45.330
Brian Nguyen: A glossary. The default is

1501
01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:46.740
Brian Nguyen: Is why you just press

1502
01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:47.940
Brian Nguyen: To press enter.

1503
01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:49.920
Brian Nguyen: Or press why and enter

1504
01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:53.040
Brian Nguyen: Okay overarm electric charge of the molecule.

1505
01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:53.850
Brian Nguyen: Is mutual

1506
01:21:53.970 --> 01:21:55.200
Aakrsh: So 03

1507
01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:55.470
Again,

1508
01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:59.820
Brian Nguyen: It's now generating the occupation of the electrons.

1509
01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:01.920
Brian Nguyen: IV count up the total electrons.

1510
01:22:02.010 --> 01:22:02.430
In your

1511
01:22:03.630 --> 01:22:05.580
Aakrsh: Senior molecule that's just some of

1512
01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:07.560
Brian Nguyen: The same number or and then it's just

1513
01:22:07.710 --> 01:22:08.850
Brian Nguyen: Awkward mind orbitals.

1514
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:09.600
Aakrsh: He says,

1515
01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:12.570
Brian Nguyen: All right, now we're in this window.

1516
01:22:13.650 --> 01:22:14.850
Brian Nguyen: Have you guys gone through that.

1517
01:22:16.530 --> 01:22:17.040
Aakrsh: Yet not

1518
01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:18.270
Yet

1519
01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:20.190
Aakrsh: Can you go back

1520
01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:22.470
Theresa Carlos: To before

1521
01:22:25.290 --> 01:22:25.800
Brian Nguyen: He

1522
01:22:26.610 --> 01:22:27.930
Theresa Carlos: Before he

1523
01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:29.190
Brian Nguyen: Before he

1524
01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:30.690
Starts

1525
01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:34.860
Brian Nguyen: Yes, this armies to terminate the

1526
01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:38.520
Brian Nguyen: Session. Once you're done with a section, you just respond

1527
01:22:38.970 --> 01:22:40.620
Aakrsh: Okay, okay.

1528
01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:41.820
Aakrsh: Going back to you.

1529
01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.730
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so now

1530
01:22:46.410 --> 01:22:48.000
Aakrsh: We're going to choose the method that we want to use

1531
01:22:49.230 --> 01:22:50.730
Brian Nguyen: Right. He

1532
01:22:52.650 --> 01:22:56.490
Brian Nguyen: Stands for instance the functional theory right DSP.

1533
01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:00.570
Aakrsh: It is not us.

1534
01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:03.360
Brian Nguyen: We want to use that type lens on

1535
01:23:06.450 --> 01:23:07.320
That turns that on

1536
01:23:08.670 --> 01:23:09.060
Brian Nguyen: Now,

1537
01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:10.590
Aakrsh: This is the method.

1538
01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:12.660
Brian Nguyen: There's not different methods out there.

1539
01:23:13.410 --> 01:23:14.310
Brian Nguyen: Where we're going to use

1540
01:23:15.930 --> 01:23:17.220
Aakrsh: It to change that method.

1541
01:23:17.610 --> 01:23:20.070
Brian Nguyen: With type funk TV.

1542
01:23:23.190 --> 01:23:28.320
Brian Nguyen: Okay, now if you type in just funk, you see a list of different methods available.

1543
01:23:30.210 --> 01:23:30.720
Aakrsh: All right.

1544
01:23:31.530 --> 01:23:33.420
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, I see how there's a bunch of messages there.

1545
01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:36.540
Brian Nguyen: So this one is the method.

1546
01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:37.080
Aakrsh: Alright.

1547
01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:38.880
Brian Nguyen: Alright, until the

1548
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:43.980
Brian Nguyen: So I'm going to pose this question for everyone. All right, in the chat.

1549
01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:45.360
Brian Nguyen: So you guys can

1550
01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:46.200
Brian Nguyen: Think about it.

1551
01:23:49.710 --> 01:23:52.260
Brian Nguyen: So can get get get get get a feeling for this.

1552
01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:54.480
Brian Nguyen: Okay, which method.

1553
01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:57.570
Aakrsh: Or accurate and why

1554
01:23:57.900 --> 01:23:58.680
Brian Nguyen: Right, or

1555
01:24:00.150 --> 01:24:00.450
Aakrsh: No.

1556
01:24:01.770 --> 01:24:04.950
Brian Nguyen: Okay and and does accuracy.

1557
01:24:07.290 --> 01:24:09.990
Brian Nguyen: Depend on the basis

1558
01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:14.400
Brian Nguyen: Right. So there's a lot of different

1559
01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:15.330
Aakrsh: Basis that so

1560
01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:18.210
Brian Nguyen: There. So we'll walk to investigate that too.

1561
01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:23.910
Brian Nguyen: So those are two questions, and they'll try to look into. So I did just a way to get to familiarize with. All right.

1562
01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:26.730
Brian Nguyen: There at all different methods out there.

1563
01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:28.860
Brian Nguyen: So methods, a little bit more accurate.

1564
01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:31.560
Aakrsh: And we'll try to explore that.

1565
01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:34.860
Brian Nguyen: All right, two X's this window just press enter again.

1566
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:36.270
Aakrsh: Okay.

1567
01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:38.580
Brian Nguyen: So we're done here.

1568
01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:40.620
Brian Nguyen: We are press star.

1569
01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:47.640
Brian Nguyen: All right, again, when you go to our I

1570
01:24:48.090 --> 01:24:48.900
Parameters.

1571
01:24:53.250 --> 01:24:54.540
Brian Nguyen: And then we're going to turn that on.

1572
01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:55.920
Up.

1573
01:24:58.680 --> 01:24:59.130
Aakrsh: All right.

1574
01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:00.030
Brian Nguyen: That's it.

1575
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:06.240
Brian Nguyen: So, generally they give you a really

1576
01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:08.130
Brian Nguyen: general idea what our ideas.

1577
01:25:08.610 --> 01:25:09.210
Brian Nguyen: Are I help

1578
01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:11.970
Brian Nguyen: You to speed up the calculation to

1579
01:25:13.050 --> 01:25:13.410
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1580
01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:15.660
Brian Nguyen: For people who are familiar with calculus.

1581
01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:20.070
Brian Nguyen: Essentially when you're competing you're integrals.

1582
01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:21.480
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1583
01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:26.040
Brian Nguyen: Think of this as a giant meters.

1584
01:25:26.730 --> 01:25:27.810
Brian Nguyen: You guys know what makes

1585
01:25:28.050 --> 01:25:29.310
Brian Nguyen: Right, okay.

1586
01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:31.410
Brian Nguyen: These guys has a very

1587
01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:32.550
Brian Nguyen: There's a giant matrix and

1588
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:33.330
Brian Nguyen: It's a buy

1589
01:25:33.930 --> 01:25:35.550
Brian Nguyen: 1 million by 1 million

1590
01:25:36.210 --> 01:25:38.730
Aakrsh: All right, that's a lot of calculations and each

1591
01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:41.970
Brian Nguyen: Element is integral to compete and

1592
01:25:42.030 --> 01:25:48.480
Aakrsh: Because our I essentially what it does is that ignores a certain number of integral

1593
01:25:49.710 --> 01:25:51.840
Brian Nguyen: Okay, because sometimes those integrations.

1594
01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:53.070
Aakrsh: Are very small

1595
01:25:53.190 --> 01:25:54.510
Brian Nguyen: You guys contribute to the energy

1596
01:25:55.050 --> 01:25:55.350
Okay.

1597
01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:59.610
Brian Nguyen: That's the general idea to say to the general idea is that all right.

1598
01:26:00.090 --> 01:26:01.260
Brian Nguyen: beats up your calculations.

1599
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:03.030
Brian Nguyen: Are enormous certain numbers of

1600
01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:04.260
Aakrsh: Intervals. Okay.

1601
01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:05.790
Brian Nguyen: We're done here.

1602
01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:11.280
Brian Nguyen: I think that's it. So that's all. Yeah.

1603
01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.410
Brian Nguyen: That's all she wrote. Right.

1604
01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:14.490
Brian Nguyen: So we pitched our

1605
01:26:17.220 --> 01:26:17.940
Brian Nguyen: To Ella.

1606
01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:18.870
Brian Nguyen: What's in it.

1607
01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:21.720
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so we generate some new file.

1608
01:26:23.130 --> 01:26:23.730
Aakrsh: We have

1609
01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:25.380
Brian Nguyen: A basis, which was

1610
01:26:25.530 --> 01:26:26.670
Brian Nguyen: What we were talking about earlier.

1611
01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:35.370
Brian Nguyen: The basis of we have ox basis. This is where we turn our eyes. Right. And we have the control file.

1612
01:26:35.730 --> 01:26:37.290
Brian Nguyen: This is all the parameters.

1613
01:26:38.250 --> 01:26:39.120
Brian Nguyen: You have in there.

1614
01:26:39.390 --> 01:26:41.520
Brian Nguyen: You kind of modify it. Alright.

1615
01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:45.330
Brian Nguyen: So we can end this is the emos can look over those that

1616
01:26:45.330 --> 01:26:46.830
Aakrsh: Were generated. Okay.

1617
01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:52.560
Brian Nguyen: So let's let's look into each of these files are you guys are summarized what was in it.

1618
01:26:52.710 --> 01:26:53.820
Brian Nguyen: So there's a control file.

1619
01:26:57.330 --> 01:26:57.660
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1620
01:26:58.230 --> 01:26:59.160
Aakrsh: Do you notice that

1621
01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:01.890
Brian Nguyen: You know, here's a title tonight is the cemetery.

1622
01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:03.600
Brian Nguyen: Is the basis that you use.

1623
01:27:04.770 --> 01:27:05.100
Okay.

1624
01:27:07.470 --> 01:27:09.270
Brian Nguyen: You just tell me the parameters of India.

1625
01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:12.180
Aakrsh: So you guys are with

1626
01:27:12.570 --> 01:27:12.960
All right.

1627
01:27:14.370 --> 01:27:21.750
Brian Nguyen: This is some of the memory. There's a bunch of parameters, right, Harry, the bunch. Right. But the interesting thing that you make sure is that you have the correct functional

1628
01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:27.990
Aakrsh: Right movies or we call it the method and then

1629
01:27:29.550 --> 01:27:31.020
Brian Nguyen: We know that we turn our eyes.

1630
01:27:31.530 --> 01:27:31.800
Okay.

1631
01:27:34.050 --> 01:27:34.590
Brian Nguyen: And that's it.

1632
01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:37.380
Aakrsh: So,

1633
01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:43.830
Brian Nguyen: This calculation would run a quick. Alright, though he lives in do is important.

1634
01:27:43.890 --> 01:27:45.660
Aakrsh: To run a geometry optimization

1635
01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:46.830
Brian Nguyen: It command is called

1636
01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:47.520
Brian Nguyen: Job that

1637
01:27:49.710 --> 01:27:50.490
Aakrsh: Way. Mr. Right.

1638
01:27:51.690 --> 01:27:51.960
Aakrsh: Yes.

1639
01:27:53.130 --> 01:28:09.780
Aakrsh: Okay, so for basis and octopuses octopuses is the ones like RI, so it has like some less so it generally has all the information of basis like basically I'm asking for basis is just all the information of ox basis, plus some

1640
01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:14.340
Brian Nguyen: OK, so the basis

1641
01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:16.170
Brian Nguyen: described her

1642
01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:16.500
Aakrsh: As a

1643
01:28:16.530 --> 01:28:17.100
Brian Nguyen: Whole space.

1644
01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:21.630
Brian Nguyen: Okay. And I think the oxidative stress smaller space within that basis. Yes.

1645
01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:22.290
Brian Nguyen: So I

1646
01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:23.670
Brian Nguyen: Kind of speaker that way.

1647
01:28:24.270 --> 01:28:27.240
Brian Nguyen: Right. And I'm going to use some film come late 60s.

1648
01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:32.760
Brian Nguyen: Example, I think the notation that we do is eliminate some of the English girls.

1649
01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:33.480
Okay.

1650
01:28:34.650 --> 01:28:36.690
Brian Nguyen: I'm probably explaining some more tomorrow to

1651
01:28:36.750 --> 01:28:37.890
Brian Nguyen: Yourself by so

1652
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:39.630
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1653
01:28:40.890 --> 01:28:41.580
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, so this is

1654
01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:46.500
Brian Nguyen: This is why, this is why I kind of want a separate office hours with the lecture today.

1655
01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:49.860
Brian Nguyen: So I came up. Sure, I can give you the bare bones in the

1656
01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:51.540
Brian Nguyen: Office hours I can give you a little bit more

1657
01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:52.890
Brian Nguyen: Information. Alright.

1658
01:28:53.610 --> 01:28:53.970
Okay.

1659
01:28:55.290 --> 01:28:56.700
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so now we're going to do.

1660
01:28:57.210 --> 01:28:57.750
Brian Nguyen: Job at

1661
01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:58.800
Brian Nguyen: National right

1662
01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:00.330
Alright.

1663
01:29:01.770 --> 01:29:02.490
Brian Nguyen: So that's the command.

1664
01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:05.790
Brian Nguyen: Job x is a command that runs the geology.

1665
01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:06.510
Aakrsh: Opposition.

1666
01:29:07.170 --> 01:29:08.490
Brian Nguyen: And it's based national right

1667
01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.280
Brian Nguyen: One last thing we like to do

1668
01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:12.660
Is you have caught know help

1669
01:29:14.130 --> 01:29:14.970
Brian Nguyen: Right. No, he

1670
01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:17.250
Brian Nguyen: See no hang up.

1671
01:29:17.730 --> 01:29:19.890
Brian Nguyen: That means that you can wear your calculation in the background.

1672
01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:23.040
Brian Nguyen: And if you your calculation takes a long time.

1673
01:29:23.490 --> 01:29:25.410
Brian Nguyen: You can just draw out from the computer.

1674
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:26.970
Aakrsh: They come back to check on it.

1675
01:29:26.970 --> 01:29:27.600
Brian Nguyen: Later on,

1676
01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:31.800
Brian Nguyen: And this ensures that the calculations continue to running when you log out.

1677
01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:32.340
Aakrsh: Okay.

1678
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:36.030
Brian Nguyen: And to indicate that is the lead in the background.

1679
01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:40.080
Brian Nguyen: Question percent this is located under your shift.

1680
01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:40.950
Number seven.

1681
01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:43.770
Brian Nguyen: The press enter.

1682
01:29:46.710 --> 01:29:47.880
Brian Nguyen: Now it's pretty quick.

1683
01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:51.390
Brian Nguyen: I just the fun part is the easy part.

1684
01:29:51.630 --> 01:29:52.080
Right.

1685
01:29:53.190 --> 01:29:54.060
Aakrsh: Okay.

1686
01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.350
Brian Nguyen: So we can do Li

1687
01:29:58.290 --> 01:30:02.130
Brian Nguyen: Jerry some more files, it shows it is geo optimum rich

1688
01:30:03.150 --> 01:30:03.600
All right.

1689
01:30:05.010 --> 01:30:08.010
Brian Nguyen: And if you want to see the each cycle.

1690
01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:09.780
Brian Nguyen: Will do graph X gradient

1691
01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:14.580
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so you should see

1692
01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:16.740
Brian Nguyen: That who's the energy generated

1693
01:30:17.250 --> 01:30:18.060
Brian Nguyen: The initial step.

1694
01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:20.700
Brian Nguyen: And here's the energy

1695
01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:21.840
Aakrsh: Again,

1696
01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:24.030
Brian Nguyen: As improved right

1697
01:30:25.650 --> 01:30:26.820
Brian Nguyen: The idea is that after

1698
01:30:26.850 --> 01:30:28.590
Brian Nguyen: Each cycle iteration.

1699
01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:29.700
Alright.

1700
01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:33.510
Aakrsh: So the idea is the way it works.

1701
01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:36.690
Brian Nguyen: I'm just going to explain it that you have your orbital.

1702
01:30:37.290 --> 01:30:38.610
Brian Nguyen: Okay, and just trying to

1703
01:30:39.630 --> 01:30:40.980
Brian Nguyen: Find the best orbital.

1704
01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:43.200
Brian Nguyen: To describe your molecule purge right

1705
01:30:43.770 --> 01:30:45.570
Brian Nguyen: Once you get to that it didn't.

1706
01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:47.820
It didn't

1707
01:30:49.770 --> 01:30:52.560
Aakrsh: compute the derivative or here.

1708
01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:56.550
Brian Nguyen: Is the route that we're talking about.

1709
01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:58.170
Brian Nguyen: And the slope. Right.

1710
01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:01.950
Brian Nguyen: Yeah. And the idea is that these are

1711
01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:04.080
Brian Nguyen: run these calculations that can

1712
01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:05.760
Brian Nguyen: Be exactly zero. Okay.

1713
01:31:06.810 --> 01:31:08.100
Brian Nguyen: Because we're approximating

1714
01:31:08.610 --> 01:31:09.300
Aakrsh: All these things.

1715
01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:11.280
Brian Nguyen: But what we want to do is you want to get as

1716
01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:11.670
Close.

1717
01:31:13.170 --> 01:31:14.220
Aakrsh: To accurate.

1718
01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:16.230
Brian Nguyen: Result in a way to show that

1719
01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:17.310
Brian Nguyen: Is that

1720
01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:19.980
Brian Nguyen: If our cycle.

1721
01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:21.750
Brian Nguyen: Here and you hear

1722
01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:23.670
Brian Nguyen: The difference between these two.

1723
01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:24.810
Brian Nguyen: Numbers.

1724
01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:26.700
Aakrsh: Are within a certain tolerance.

1725
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:27.270
Aakrsh: And we said,

1726
01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:28.830
Brian Nguyen: We will consider that

1727
01:31:30.090 --> 01:31:30.480
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1728
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:33.180
Brian Nguyen: In our cases it was within like 10 to the minus

1729
01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:35.400
Brian Nguyen: Three attention to my

1730
01:31:36.510 --> 01:31:36.750
Brian Nguyen: OK.

1731
01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:38.310
Aakrsh: So the third decimal, actually. Sorry.

1732
01:31:39.570 --> 01:31:39.960
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

1733
01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:43.560
Brian Nguyen: So that's one criteria and other criteria is

1734
01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:44.880
This energy here.

1735
01:31:46.290 --> 01:31:48.540
Brian Nguyen: Doesn't change within 10 to the minus six.

1736
01:31:49.050 --> 01:31:51.120
Brian Nguyen: OK, so the six decimal place right here.

1737
01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:55.440
Aakrsh: Alright.

1738
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:57.570
Aakrsh: So that's how

1739
01:31:58.110 --> 01:32:01.590
Brian Nguyen: Some of the criteria as we define party on pre authorization

1740
01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:02.340
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1741
01:32:03.090 --> 01:32:05.580
Brian Nguyen: And here's a question. This is

1742
01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:10.290
Brian Nguyen: It just gives you a converged result. So we want to verify

1743
01:32:10.410 --> 01:32:12.510
Brian Nguyen: That the molecule is truly at a ground.

1744
01:32:12.510 --> 01:32:15.150
Brian Nguyen: State right and we run a real force.

1745
01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:17.520
Aakrsh: A, of course.

1746
01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:19.230
Aakrsh: And what that

1747
01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:20.730
Brian Nguyen: does is that it tied to

1748
01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:22.620
Brian Nguyen: It looks at the

1749
01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:27.210
Brian Nguyen: The vibrational so molecules to vibrate.

1750
01:32:27.630 --> 01:32:28.680
Brian Nguyen: Is what we call it vibrate.

1751
01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:29.010
Aakrsh: Okay.

1752
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:31.170
Brian Nguyen: And this allows us can

1753
01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:31.800
Explain.

1754
01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:36.300
Brian Nguyen: Determine whether or not your molecules that are true ground state.

1755
01:32:36.810 --> 01:32:37.200
Okay.

1756
01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:39.450
Brian Nguyen: So we'll just type that in.

1757
01:32:41.220 --> 01:32:42.960
Brian Nguyen: We did the same thing no help to

1758
01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:47.700
Brian Nguyen: Just in case. But this is pretty quick calculation is that

1759
01:32:48.510 --> 01:32:48.900
Right.

1760
01:32:51.450 --> 01:32:53.250
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so a of course

1761
01:32:54.390 --> 01:32:56.580
Brian Nguyen: This remember that this thing. I'll put the file.

1762
01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:57.000
Aakrsh: Right.

1763
01:32:57.330 --> 01:32:59.010
Brian Nguyen: Now we're going to look at a file.

1764
01:33:04.650 --> 01:33:06.360
Brian Nguyen: Alright, and now we see the output.

1765
01:33:06.810 --> 01:33:07.140
Brian Nguyen: For a

1766
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:09.450
Brian Nguyen: Girl in

1767
01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:11.520
Brian Nguyen: The bunch of thing.

1768
01:33:14.490 --> 01:33:15.990
Brian Nguyen: It reads into the model.

1769
01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:16.800
Brian Nguyen: The atoms.

1770
01:33:18.210 --> 01:33:19.290
Brian Nguyen: Reason the basis that

1771
01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:23.670
Aakrsh: Region that

1772
01:33:25.170 --> 01:33:26.490
Aakrsh: He's in the UK very business it

1773
01:33:27.150 --> 01:33:27.630
Aakrsh: All right.

1774
01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:34.380
Brian Nguyen: Do some more calculations, blah.

1775
01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:37.290
Aakrsh: And here's what we're interested in.

1776
01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:40.410
Aakrsh: The

1777
01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:42.690
Aakrsh: vibrational frequency

1778
01:33:42.810 --> 01:33:44.520
Brian Nguyen: And normal modes of your molecule.

1779
01:33:44.970 --> 01:33:45.420
Alright.

1780
01:33:46.830 --> 01:33:48.570
Aakrsh: So what you want to

1781
01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:51.030
Brian Nguyen: Find here is that the first

1782
01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:52.290
Brian Nguyen: user base, no state.

1783
01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:56.370
Brian Nguyen: Is zero. There's no imaginary

1784
01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:58.350
Aakrsh: Okay.

1785
01:33:58.950 --> 01:34:01.680
Brian Nguyen: How to know that there's imaginary if there is an eye.

1786
01:34:02.010 --> 01:34:02.580
Aakrsh: Next to this.

1787
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:03.390
Okay.

1788
01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:08.040
Brian Nguyen: And I will indicate that your molecule is not

1789
01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:11.010
Brian Nguyen: At a ground state, and you need to rerun topics.

1790
01:34:11.010 --> 01:34:11.310
Again,

1791
01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:16.740
Brian Nguyen: This is one of one of the ways to do a sanity check.

1792
01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:19.980
Brian Nguyen: Of your, your calculation. OK.

1793
01:34:20.970 --> 01:34:21.780
Aakrsh: Questions. They're good.

1794
01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:24.450
Brian Nguyen: Night.

1795
01:34:25.470 --> 01:34:27.990
Brian Nguyen: You know, I can try to explain this a little bit more

1796
01:34:28.350 --> 01:34:31.770
Brian Nguyen: Tomorrow and say, and also there is a lot of things.

1797
01:34:31.770 --> 01:34:33.960
Brian Nguyen: To say slinky because it's

1798
01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:35.010
Aakrsh: Bare bones. So you guys

1799
01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:36.630
Okay, what things does

1800
01:34:38.490 --> 01:34:42.150
Brian Nguyen: All right, good. All right, so that's good.

1801
01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:45.060
Brian Nguyen: So there's your very first terrible calculation.

1802
01:34:45.450 --> 01:34:47.580
Brian Nguyen: Very simple, very easy right

1803
01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:50.460
Brian Nguyen: So we're gonna talk a little bit

1804
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.590
Alright, so let's make a directory

1805
01:34:53.970 --> 01:35:01.170
Brian Nguyen: And call it PB alright so generally you want to make folders that corresponds to the method that you

1806
01:35:01.170 --> 01:35:01.440
Use

1807
01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:03.000
Aakrsh: Okay.

1808
01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:05.910
Brian Nguyen: And so, and then we're going to do one last thing.

1809
01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:08.220
We're going to TV.

1810
01:35:09.570 --> 01:35:10.260
Brian Nguyen: And we're going to make

1811
01:35:10.620 --> 01:35:13.380
Aakrsh: The directory depth to at the p

1812
01:35:14.730 --> 01:35:15.870
Brian Nguyen: Alright, that's it.

1813
01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:18.330
Brian Nguyen: But this is kind of the way you want to kind of

1814
01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:19.290
Brian Nguyen: Organize your things

1815
01:35:19.650 --> 01:35:21.360
Aakrsh: Right. So now we're going to do and the

1816
01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:25.020
Aakrsh: Route move everything in here.

1817
01:35:26.250 --> 01:35:27.450
Brian Nguyen: All right, we'll press star.

1818
01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:28.560
Brian Nguyen: And just type in

1819
01:35:28.710 --> 01:35:29.550
Aakrsh: Just to execute

1820
01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:35.280
Brian Nguyen: All right, it's okay to smear is trying to tell a story.

1821
01:35:37.050 --> 01:35:37.590
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

1822
01:35:38.730 --> 01:35:39.480
Brian Nguyen: See, see that

1823
01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:41.250
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1824
01:35:42.330 --> 01:35:45.780
Brian Nguyen: So for practice. I want you guys

1825
01:35:46.170 --> 01:35:46.560
Aakrsh: To make

1826
01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:47.670
Make directory

1827
01:35:49.710 --> 01:35:50.400
Aakrsh: Yes to

1828
01:35:50.730 --> 01:35:51.810
PvP

1829
01:35:52.950 --> 01:35:53.460
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1830
01:35:54.810 --> 01:35:56.190
Brian Nguyen: And what we're gonna do.

1831
01:35:56.490 --> 01:35:58.860
Brian Nguyen: We're going to go to win a copy

1832
01:36:00.090 --> 01:36:00.930
Brian Nguyen: The core file.

1833
01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:02.520
Brian Nguyen: In depth to FTP

1834
01:36:06.030 --> 01:36:11.070
Brian Nguyen: And two deputies easy. Alright, so remember the question I asked in

1835
01:36:11.070 --> 01:36:11.520
Brian Nguyen: Chat.

1836
01:36:12.090 --> 01:36:13.140
Brian Nguyen: Does the basis that

1837
01:36:13.170 --> 01:36:14.190
Brian Nguyen: Change the

1838
01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:16.740
Brian Nguyen: overall accuracy of

1839
01:36:16.740 --> 01:36:19.110
Aakrsh: It. Okay, so

1840
01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:21.150
Brian Nguyen: I want you guys to practice.

1841
01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:23.280
Brian Nguyen: Regenerate.

1842
01:36:23.430 --> 01:36:24.180
Brian Nguyen: This file.

1843
01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:27.510
Brian Nguyen: Rerun the calculation with a different basis set

1844
01:36:28.710 --> 01:36:29.130
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1845
01:36:30.270 --> 01:36:31.110
Brian Nguyen: That's first step.

1846
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.970
Brian Nguyen: The second step.

1847
01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:33.750
Aakrsh: Is

1848
01:36:33.810 --> 01:36:35.280
Aakrsh: I want you guys to run

1849
01:36:35.370 --> 01:36:36.570
Brian Nguyen: TPS as he

1850
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:39.150
Brian Nguyen: A different method.

1851
01:36:42.450 --> 01:36:45.060
Brian Nguyen: I want to run it with two different bases set to

1852
01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:46.410
SCP

1853
01:36:54.450 --> 01:36:57.090
Brian Nguyen: Do the same thing, but this time around.

1854
01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:58.560
Brian Nguyen: Run different lessons.

1855
01:36:58.620 --> 01:36:59.070
Brian Nguyen: On it.

1856
01:37:00.630 --> 01:37:02.130
Brian Nguyen: And last one.

1857
01:37:02.370 --> 01:37:04.920
Brian Nguyen: For kicks will call this

1858
01:37:07.470 --> 01:37:12.750
Brian Nguyen: That I think I'll leave this right here. All right. Can you guys do this for me.

1859
01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:14.760
Brian Nguyen: For next

1860
01:37:15.180 --> 01:37:15.750
Brian Nguyen: 20 minutes

1861
01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:17.040
Alright.

1862
01:37:18.330 --> 01:37:21.240
Brian Nguyen: So we'll call this a mini lab session.

1863
01:37:21.690 --> 01:37:22.080
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1864
01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:24.690
Brian Nguyen: Before we get started, they have a

1865
01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:25.200
Question.

1866
01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:29.880
Aakrsh: More still running with water right

1867
01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:31.560
Brian Nguyen: Yes, same one.

1868
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:32.880
Brian Nguyen: We're trying to keep

1869
01:37:32.910 --> 01:37:35.190
Aakrsh: Everything consistent right

1870
01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:36.660
Brian Nguyen: You know you want to.

1871
01:37:36.930 --> 01:37:37.470
Brian Nguyen: Change a

1872
01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:39.570
Brian Nguyen: Few variables as possible.

1873
01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:41.160
Aakrsh: Right when you're running an experiment. Right.

1874
01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:42.720
Brian Nguyen: This is one way

1875
01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:44.460
Brian Nguyen: Right, we're all going to run on water.

1876
01:37:45.090 --> 01:37:46.590
Aakrsh: And we're all trying to try to see what

1877
01:37:46.890 --> 01:37:54.210
Brian Nguyen: What what what we get the energy to total energy quit. Okay. And then we're going to compare this to a very accurate that

1878
01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:55.950
Brian Nguyen: See which methods with

1879
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:57.600
Brian Nguyen: Which that is accurate. Okay.

1880
01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:00.270
Can you see

1881
01:38:02.730 --> 01:38:03.030
Brian Nguyen: Yes.

1882
01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:06.090
Brian Nguyen: So remember that in the chat. I wrote in the chat.

1883
01:38:06.210 --> 01:38:06.720
Brian Nguyen: I said,

1884
01:38:09.090 --> 01:38:09.960
Brian Nguyen: Which methods.

1885
01:38:10.110 --> 01:38:11.040
Brian Nguyen: To the most accurate.

1886
01:38:12.030 --> 01:38:13.530
Brian Nguyen: And how how

1887
01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:15.030
Brian Nguyen: Does the basic that affects

1888
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.900
Aakrsh: The activities.

1889
01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:23.580
Brian Nguyen: Okay. And so when you run the car shop ization we're going to try to look at the total energy

1890
01:38:24.330 --> 01:38:26.190
Brian Nguyen: We're going to look at the bond distances.

1891
01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:29.640
Brian Nguyen: Right. And it was a look at the bond angle.

1892
01:38:30.450 --> 01:38:33.420
Aakrsh: All right, and then we're going to compare this to

1893
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:35.850
Brian Nguyen: A reference some some very hot.

1894
01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:36.240
Brian Nguyen: Very

1895
01:38:36.270 --> 01:38:38.310
Brian Nguyen: accurate calculations or experiments.

1896
01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:39.570
Brian Nguyen: That we have. All right.

1897
01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:42.750
Brian Nguyen: So generally, we want to be able to

1898
01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:48.030
Brian Nguyen: match our calculation with our experiments. Okay. All right, so

1899
01:38:48.990 --> 01:38:52.260
Brian Nguyen: What I want you guys to do is has kept PV already

1900
01:38:52.770 --> 01:38:53.910
Brian Nguyen: I'm worried that it goes to the same

1901
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:54.990
Brian Nguyen: Step this

1902
01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:56.400
Aakrsh: Step TTP

1903
01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:57.480
Aakrsh: With their basis.

1904
01:38:58.590 --> 01:39:01.740
Brian Nguyen: And then also wanted to guys use a different method.

1905
01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:05.940
Brian Nguyen: Okay, and the same basis it

1906
01:39:06.450 --> 01:39:06.870
Alright.

1907
01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:11.100
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

1908
01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:13.170
Aakrsh: This is kind of put you guys into

1909
01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:17.340
Brian Nguyen: Practice. So this guy is going to give you a feel for what's happening.

1910
01:39:18.540 --> 01:39:18.930
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1911
01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:29.490
Aakrsh: Brian

1912
01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:31.860
Aakrsh: Hundreds.

1913
01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:32.550
Aakrsh: Of

1914
01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:33.930
Jeffrey Tsai: What we went over just now.

1915
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:36.450
Jeffrey Tsai: With just like bare bones directions and

1916
01:39:37.530 --> 01:39:38.700
Jeffrey Tsai: The more detailed procedure.

1917
01:39:40.170 --> 01:39:42.330
Jeffrey Tsai: So sure, I'm done writing up

1918
01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:46.500
Aakrsh: To write up

1919
01:39:47.730 --> 01:39:48.090
Aakrsh: Yeah.

1920
01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:49.290
Jeffrey Tsai: There's so

1921
01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:52.620
But yet you say

1922
01:39:55.980 --> 01:40:00.090
Jeffrey Tsai: Also, it's a pain to the gods, because there's a bunch of dependencies.

1923
01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:05.220
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, yeah. I think if he did you

1924
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:09.840
Brian Nguyen: Do app get don't have a gadget should be fine.

1925
01:40:10.710 --> 01:40:14.340
Jeffrey Tsai: I tried that. And yeah, didn't work.

1926
01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:15.750
Brian Nguyen: Out.

1927
01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:19.650
Jeffrey Tsai: And worked out because of the dependency is like see Megan.

1928
01:40:22.050 --> 01:40:22.440
Jeffrey Tsai: Cute.

1929
01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:24.150
Jeffrey Tsai: Yeah.

1930
01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:25.620
Brian Nguyen: The way.

1931
01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:26.730
Jeffrey Tsai: To

1932
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:28.530
Brian Nguyen: Bring a third of the computer.

1933
01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:34.530
Jeffrey Tsai: I mean you didn't really have much in terms of like programs everything

1934
01:40:35.610 --> 01:40:37.650
Jeffrey Tsai: And yeah, I'll

1935
01:40:38.670 --> 01:40:39.660
Jeffrey Tsai: Figure it out over time.

1936
01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:42.390
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, okay. No way.

1937
01:41:02.490 --> 01:41:02.700
Oh,

1938
01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:50.040
Brian Nguyen: Feel free to ask questions.

1939
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:54.660
Brian Nguyen: We'll reconvene again around 11

1940
01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:59.190
Brian Nguyen: So pretty fast. So hopefully

1941
01:42:00.030 --> 01:42:03.960
thanh: I see you. Can I see what you did earlier. One more time.

1942
01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:07.500
Brian Nguyen: Like what

1943
01:42:12.540 --> 01:42:13.740
thanh: Can we scroll up little

1944
01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:15.840
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1945
01:42:19.110 --> 01:42:20.010
thanh: Okay, thank you.

1946
01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:38.430
Victoria Choi: Thing again.

1947
01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:47.070
Brian Nguyen: Yes, you're gonna have to redo it for each one to get a feel for it. So, you know, there's define this is kind of setting up your calculation. Right.

1948
01:42:48.810 --> 01:42:53.130
Brian Nguyen: Is remember what does define what's the goal define define

1949
01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:59.730
Brian Nguyen: Your calculation by generating your molecular orbital. Okay.

1950
01:43:32.490 --> 01:43:33.690
Brian Nguyen: Alright, I'll be back.

1951
01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:36.660
Brian Nguyen: Jeffrey, can you take over and we'll get some water.

1952
01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:38.130
Yeah.

1953
01:43:39.810 --> 01:43:41.100
Jeffrey Tsai: Actually, let me see if I

1954
01:43:42.930 --> 01:43:46.200
Jeffrey Tsai: Can get onto the zoom one here now, so I can share screen if needed.

1955
01:45:43.410 --> 01:45:43.980
Brian Nguyen: Everyone else

1956
01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:44.910
Theresa Carlos: molecular geometry.

1957
01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:55.140
Brian Nguyen: I want you guys to compute the molecular ground state geometry.

1958
01:46:55.890 --> 01:46:56.940
Brian Nguyen: The different methods.

1959
01:46:57.180 --> 01:46:58.140
Brian Nguyen: And different basis.

1960
01:46:59.430 --> 01:46:59.760
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1961
01:47:01.170 --> 01:47:03.150
Brian Nguyen: So that's, I can't give you guys a feel.

1962
01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:05.190
Brian Nguyen: The ideas that

1963
01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:13.620
Brian Nguyen: You know, just when I get to see what happened. Okay, thanks for it, but it's kind of small, simple case.

1964
01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:17.910
Brian Nguyen: And then we'll move on to something a little bit more chemistry related

1965
01:48:24.450 --> 01:48:25.260
Brian Nguyen: Calculation.

1966
01:48:48.630 --> 01:48:49.650
Brian Nguyen: stuck somewhere.

1967
01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:45.690
Brian Nguyen: Okay, well I'll check in. Again, I love it. Alright, so hopefully, fingers crossed that you guys finish all your calculations by done. That's my optimistic.

1968
01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:36.780
Victoria Choi: So, for

1969
01:50:38.490 --> 01:50:42.630
Victoria Choi: The calculations instead of writing it all.

1970
01:50:44.250 --> 01:50:46.740
Victoria Choi: We replace it with something else.

1971
01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:53.340
Brian Nguyen: Yes, don't be all the PvP

1972
01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:57.660
Victoria Choi: All caps.

1973
01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:00.540
Brian Nguyen: Leave

1974
01:51:02.610 --> 01:51:04.050
Brian Nguyen: depth to it, lowercase.

1975
01:51:06.270 --> 01:51:09.030
Brian Nguyen: GDP all cap. Okay.

1976
01:51:09.450 --> 01:51:09.960
Thank you.

1977
01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:17.190
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

1978
01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:20.460
Brian Nguyen: See

1979
01:54:31.170 --> 01:54:33.480
Brian Nguyen: I see some confused look

1980
01:54:35.130 --> 01:54:35.520
Brian Nguyen: Chris

1981
01:54:36.690 --> 01:54:38.070
Brian Nguyen: Oh, you're, you're on mute right now.

1982
01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:46.080
Aakrsh: I terminal crash.

1983
01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:49.770
Brian Nguyen: Crash. That's okay. It happens.

1984
01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:52.020
Brian Nguyen: Happened.

1985
01:54:54.180 --> 01:54:57.270
Brian Nguyen: Oh man, so many, so many bogus happening with

1986
01:54:57.870 --> 01:54:58.440
Brian Nguyen: Your computer

1987
01:54:59.160 --> 01:54:59.700
Aakrsh: No idea.

1988
01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:01.650
Aakrsh: Okay.

1989
01:55:05.670 --> 01:55:06.360
Why are you drinking

1990
01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:11.550
Brian Nguyen: Coffee.

1991
01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:13.350
Aakrsh: Yeah, she's

1992
01:55:15.210 --> 01:55:15.420
Brian Nguyen: Ain't

1993
01:55:19.710 --> 01:55:20.820
Brian Nguyen: Email all you guys

1994
01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:22.770
Brian Nguyen: Something that you in the morning.

1995
01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:25.260
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

1996
01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:30.810
Brian Nguyen: Well, we'll take a look at that will be our next step after this project, right.

1997
01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:36.840
Aakrsh: Alright so molecular structures. Yes, they're all

1998
01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:45.750
Brian Nguyen: Like three structures, I get I've already optimized them all. Okay, I'll, I'll explain this later on. Okay. I have a few things that

1999
01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:47.190
Aakrsh: Like you guys to do with that.

2000
01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:49.950
Brian Nguyen: First

2001
01:55:50.730 --> 01:55:51.690
Aakrsh: Purchase get started.

2002
01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:52.770
Aakrsh: All right.

2003
01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:53.970
How far you guys gotten

2004
01:55:58.950 --> 01:56:00.510
Brian Nguyen: A call and get a feel for this.

2005
01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:03.510
Brian Nguyen: Have you guys GOTTEN THE PB with

2006
01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:04.590
Brian Nguyen: Deputies easy

2007
01:56:04.590 --> 01:56:05.310
Calculation.

2008
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:16.740
Victoria Choi: I did it. I think I did it.

2009
01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:20.850
Brian Nguyen: Oh, alright. And you verify that is a

2010
01:56:20.850 --> 01:56:21.510
grantee

2011
01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:28.530
Aakrsh: Going to control to do that.

2012
01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:29.190
For

2013
01:56:30.210 --> 01:56:30.750
Brian Nguyen: Command.

2014
01:56:30.930 --> 01:56:32.310
Brian Nguyen: There's a command called so forth.

2015
01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:36.360
Brian Nguyen: So you get out put out

2016
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:41.340
Brian Nguyen: A force for Air Force to a forced out

2017
01:56:44.910 --> 01:56:47.070
Brian Nguyen: Going to verify that your structure that I found

2018
01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:56.940
Brian Nguyen: Very good, you got TV yes to PvP done for you guys.

2019
01:56:58.260 --> 01:56:59.940
thanh: I'm still working on

2020
01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:02.010
That okay

2021
01:57:03.090 --> 01:57:05.190
Brian Nguyen: We are there any don't work for in the same boat.

2022
01:57:10.230 --> 01:57:11.820
Theresa Carlos: Yeah, I'm still working on it to

2023
01:57:14.490 --> 01:57:14.790
Brian Nguyen: God

2024
01:57:16.530 --> 01:57:18.540
Theresa Carlos: I'm still figuring out how to get

2025
01:57:20.340 --> 01:57:20.700
Theresa Carlos: I can

2026
01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:25.140
Theresa Carlos: I can open

2027
01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:30.450
Theresa Carlos: So figuring out how to get to

2028
01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:33.240
Theresa Carlos: This list.

2029
01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:35.640
Theresa Carlos: Basis.

2030
01:57:37.980 --> 01:57:39.570
Brian Nguyen: share your screen. It's like, look at this.

2031
01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:41.160
Theresa Carlos: Yeah.

2032
01:57:43.170 --> 01:57:43.530
Theresa Carlos: Okay.

2033
01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:45.270
Don't worry about it. Okay.

2034
01:57:48.030 --> 01:57:49.650
Brian Nguyen: You want to make as many mistakes.

2035
01:57:50.790 --> 01:57:54.630
Brian Nguyen: You can just don't make the mistakes on exam, right.

2036
01:57:56.400 --> 01:57:57.720
Brian Nguyen: All right. Oh.

2037
01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:07.560
Brian Nguyen: That's okay. All right. All right, so this window scroll up a little bit.

2038
01:58:09.090 --> 01:58:09.990
Brian Nguyen: There you go. Oh.

2039
01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:13.770
Brian Nguyen: Oh, somehow you have nine had

2040
01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:19.950
Brian Nguyen: I think we all have three items.

2041
01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:26.220
Theresa Carlos: I have three first and I i like i did it a couple times.

2042
01:58:27.420 --> 01:58:29.640
Brian Nguyen: That's what happened. So do Control C.

2043
01:58:30.810 --> 01:58:31.590
Brian Nguyen: Or restart it.

2044
01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:36.900
Theresa Carlos: The Congo, D.

2045
01:58:40.410 --> 01:58:41.040
Brian Nguyen: One define

2046
01:58:42.780 --> 01:58:44.790
Brian Nguyen: Oh wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2047
01:58:46.620 --> 01:58:48.060
Brian Nguyen: Until de de

2048
01:58:50.070 --> 01:58:50.730
Brian Nguyen: Do LS

2049
01:58:56.160 --> 01:58:57.120
Brian Nguyen: So,

2050
01:58:59.430 --> 01:59:03.570
Brian Nguyen: Remember, we want to run our files. We want to be organized

2051
01:59:04.770 --> 01:59:06.330
Brian Nguyen: And the whole organization. Right.

2052
01:59:07.980 --> 01:59:14.340
Brian Nguyen: So we wanted. Have you move your optimize structured in the TV file folder.

2053
01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:20.790
Brian Nguyen: Is go into it CDP

2054
01:59:27.090 --> 01:59:29.580
Brian Nguyen: Star a star and see what's in it.

2055
01:59:32.340 --> 01:59:32.670
Yeah.

2056
01:59:37.350 --> 01:59:41.340
Brian Nguyen: That means that he didn't care he needs it, you're calculating coverage.

2057
01:59:41.700 --> 01:59:49.950
Brian Nguyen: 90 obviously you haven't moved to move the files into that folder. Okay, let's go back one folder.

2058
01:59:50.970 --> 01:59:52.680
Brian Nguyen: CD space double period.

2059
01:59:58.020 --> 01:59:58.440
Ls

2060
02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:05.640
Brian Nguyen: Oh, okay. I'm teacher results converge.

2061
02:00:07.860 --> 02:00:08.910
Brian Nguyen: Before this, or no.

2062
02:00:10.020 --> 02:00:12.210
Theresa Carlos: I'm not sure I'm

2063
02:00:16.110 --> 02:00:26.070
Brian Nguyen: Okay, we can use. We're going to use this as an example for, you know, for reference in the future. Now, so let's make a folder called air.

2064
02:00:31.620 --> 02:00:36.090
Brian Nguyen: Nope. Touch makes a file, we want to make a folder directory so MK dir

2065

Brian Nguyen: If you type in Control Z. That puts to calculate that puts everything in the background. All right. It's just us colon to you okay to quit. I didn't push for Ghana, f, g again.

2116
02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:33.060
Brian Nguyen: Okay, and then quit colon to

2117

Brian Nguyen: peavy

2149
02:08:32.910 --> 02:08:34.350
Brian Nguyen: Finish this window star.

2150
02:08:59.280 --> 02:08:59.940
Brian Nguyen: And then

2151
02:09:03.630 --> 02:09:13.320
Brian Nguyen: Right, you see all the files generated memos generated looks good and tool five day basis it you know are now dude, no hub and no H

2152
02:09:14.730 --> 02:09:15.570
Brian Nguyen: Up.

2153
02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:17.700
Brian Nguyen: Space.

2154
02:09:18.930 --> 02:09:24.240
Brian Nguyen: Called x to be the x space dash RI

2155
02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:28.140
Brian Nguyen: And present

2156
02:09:32.310 --> 02:09:36.510

Brian Nguyen: Enter again.

2158
02:09:43.050 --> 02:09:44.850
Brian Nguyen: It ran the calculation to ls

2159
02:09:48.150 --> 02:09:55.560
Brian Nguyen: See, now I can bridge right so now this calculation is done. Now, one last thing you want to do is a force.

2160
02:09:57.300 --> 02:10:07.500
Brian Nguyen: To double check that it is a truly a ground ground state or minimum local minima AO AO for for fo, r e and then greater than symbol.

2161
02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:14.940
Brian Nguyen: Air Force out there, generally you want the output to a file. Okay, this is one way of doing it.

2162
02:10:16.170 --> 02:10:17.190
Brian Nguyen: To force them out.

2163
02:10:20.790 --> 02:10:21.480
Theresa Carlos: You

2164
02:10:23.190 --> 02:10:25.350
Brian Nguyen: Know, just name the file as

2165
02:10:26.910 --> 02:10:27.780
Brian Nguyen: They need to kill your

2166
02:10:27.870 --> 02:10:29.550
Brian Nguyen: Air Force to type out. It'll force.

2167
02:10:34.410 --> 02:10:36.690
Brian Nguyen: Good doc out

2168
02:10:38.430 --> 02:10:41.370
Brian Nguyen: Out, out right now. Okay.

2169
02:10:42.690 --> 02:10:54.570
Brian Nguyen: That is, it is a way to say that it is Tantra output, you know, just remember that it is it is whatever way you want to name it fits and make sure that you you're aware, okay. Yeah.

2170
02:10:58.620 --> 02:11:02.190
Brian Nguyen: All right, there we go. So your first calculations done

2171
02:11:03.210 --> 02:11:07.830
Brian Nguyen: If you take out the Air Force file. And if you do graph X gradient to grow.

2172
02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:12.060
Brian Nguyen: X gradient

2173
02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:14.760
And

2174
02:11:16.140 --> 02:11:27.990
Brian Nguyen: That gives you the energy. Okay. And that gives you the rudest alright respect to your energy, your energy respect to a jury and respect your decision you electronically, or your Adam's

2175
02:11:28.830 --> 02:11:37.020
Brian Nguyen: Right. And the way it shows that converges is by comparing the last two cycles it there within a certain tolerance.

2176
02:11:37.860 --> 02:11:44.430
Brian Nguyen: I mean is converging. Right. So, for example, the energy doesn't change up to the sixth decimal.

2177
02:11:45.540 --> 02:11:53.250
Brian Nguyen: And if the if the derivative doesn't change up to the third or fourth decimal place. You're good, okay.

2178
02:11:54.570 --> 02:11:58.110
Brian Nguyen: All right. And if you look at the AFL CIO forum.

02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:37.530
Brian Nguyen: The output.

2184
02:12:42.570 --> 02:12:45.450
Brian Nguyen: You can also press Control F to go forward.

2185
02:12:50.220 --> 02:12:51.780
Brian Nguyen: And control vehicle backwards.

2186
02:12:54.420 --> 02:12:56.100
Brian Nguyen: Control forward on foreign

2187
02:12:59.130 --> 02:13:01.050
Brian Nguyen: Relations, we

2188
02:13:04.620 --> 02:13:04.920

Brian Nguyen: Back to that.

2190
02:13:10.350 --> 02:13:12.210
Brian Nguyen: So if you look at the frequency

2191
02:13:14.070 --> 02:13:23.130
Brian Nguyen: First to free your first few if you can see or non negative or zero or positive, you're fine. That means that your structure that account state. Okay.

2192
02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:30.780
Brian Nguyen: At a minimum, alright so that's it and you can you repeat that for a different method in this basis.

2193
02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:32.850
Brian Nguyen: Does that help you

2194
02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:39.270

02:15:16.290 --> 02:15:20.130
Brian Nguyen: All right, and then Victoria. How's it going,

2230
02:15:20.850 --> 02:15:25.950
Victoria Choi: Um, I finished all of them, but I just now realized that

2231
02:15:26.550 --> 02:15:27.690
Victoria Choi: I didn't do

2232
02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:29.430
Aakrsh: The TP SSH.

2233
02:15:29.430 --> 02:15:31.170
Victoria Choi: Right, because I

2234
02:15:31.230 --> 02:15:31.500
Victoria Choi: Thought

2235
02:15:31.770 --> 02:15:34.410
Brian Nguyen: He instead of

2236
02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:39.240
Brian Nguyen: Me to redo that that happened to. So there's two issues.

2237
02:15:39.630 --> 02:15:40.110
Brian Nguyen: To way.

2238
02:15:40.140 --> 02:15:41.670
Brian Nguyen: Of conduct.

2239
02:15:43.260 --> 02:15:49.200
Brian Nguyen: We can fix it and it tried to fix it so that in the future, people can see how to fix it.

2240
02:15:49.380 --> 02:15:50.070
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so

2241
02:15:50.370 --> 02:15:51.480
Brian Nguyen: You sharing your screen.

2242
02:15:53.220 --> 02:15:55.260
Aakrsh: And then everyone to just kind of follow around

2243
02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:56.430
Brian Nguyen: You kind of

2244
02:15:58.320 --> 02:15:59.250
Brian Nguyen: Get this session.

2245
02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:00.210
Okay.

2246
02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:02.340
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

2247
02:16:04.530 --> 02:16:05.910
Aakrsh: All right, can you make that a

2248
02:16:05.940 --> 02:16:07.320
Brian Nguyen: Terminal a little bit bigger.

2249
02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:07.560
I

2250
02:16:13.530 --> 02:16:13.980
Aakrsh: Think you can

2251
02:16:14.790 --> 02:16:17.820
Brian Nguyen: Do, Control Shift plus

2252
02:16:18.150 --> 02:16:18.870
Aakrsh: Does that work.

2253
02:16:20.010 --> 02:16:20.520
Victoria Choi: Now,

2254
02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:24.780
I can make the text bigger

2255
02:16:25.950 --> 02:16:26.250
Brian Nguyen: Is it

2256
02:16:26.700 --> 02:16:27.120
Just

2257
02:16:30.510 --> 02:16:32.010
Victoria Choi: I can just call it this.

2258
02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:36.930
Brian Nguyen: Perfect, yeah it's you that. There you go. That's perfect. There we can get

2259
02:16:38.370 --> 02:16:40.140
Brian Nguyen: All right. Okay.

2260
02:16:41.640 --> 02:16:43.950
Brian Nguyen: It's going to death to SVP

2261
02:16:49.710 --> 02:16:51.660
Aakrsh: All right. Alright, a converged.

2262
02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:58.890
Brian Nguyen: Create. Now let's look at the control file. So there's two way of fixing this issue. I'll show them both ways.

2263
02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:01.470
Aakrsh: One is you either directly

2264
02:17:02.070 --> 02:17:04.200
Brian Nguyen: Edit the control file.

2265
02:17:05.340 --> 02:17:05.730
Brian Nguyen: All right.

2266
02:17:07.140 --> 02:17:09.150
Brian Nguyen: There also, it's not the right basis, either.

2267
02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:16.020
Brian Nguyen: Okay. Is that supposed to be death to SVP alright so that's one issue.

2268
02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:17.340
Brian Nguyen: So,

2269
02:17:18.210 --> 02:17:21.090
Brian Nguyen: Okay, scroll down. So if you have an issue with

2270
02:17:21.150 --> 02:17:23.520
Brian Nguyen: Just the wrong message being used.

2271
02:17:23.550 --> 02:17:24.960
Brian Nguyen: To scroll down to the

2272
02:17:26.580 --> 02:17:28.590
Aakrsh: part where it says TV. Okay.

2273
02:17:28.650 --> 02:17:32.100
Brian Nguyen: You see that PB there. The move that cursor.

2274
02:17:32.130 --> 02:17:33.660
Brian Nguyen: Up to the PPT

2275
02:17:35.190 --> 02:17:45.480
Brian Nguyen: Right, and then you can edit that directly and do insert and then TP SSH type of TPS have a dog collar workers okay escape.

2276
02:17:47.250 --> 02:17:49.530
Brian Nguyen: And then save and quit.

2277
02:17:50.580 --> 02:17:50.970
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

2278
02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:52.830
Aakrsh: So we're gonna run

2279
02:17:54.750 --> 02:17:55.920
Brian Nguyen: Defined because

2280
02:17:56.310 --> 02:17:57.780
Brian Nguyen: The basis is not correct.

2281
02:17:57.810 --> 02:18:00.270
Aakrsh: And you get to sec okay

2282
02:18:05.640 --> 02:18:08.250
Brian Nguyen: OK, so now it basically what it does.

2283
02:18:08.310 --> 02:18:11.790
Brian Nguyen: Is can be a little bit different. So it's basically reading your control.

2284
02:18:11.790 --> 02:18:12.210
Brian Nguyen: File.

2285
02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:15.960
Brian Nguyen: The first one is the line. It says symmetry CS

2286
02:18:16.170 --> 02:18:18.000
Brian Nguyen: Right, so that's just reading your geometry.

2287
02:18:18.330 --> 02:18:19.890
Brian Nguyen: We're fine with that. Alright.

2288
02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:20.790
Aakrsh: The next one is

2289
02:18:20.850 --> 02:18:21.960
Aakrsh: The atomic structure.

2290
02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:22.830
Brian Nguyen: The data.

2291
02:18:22.950 --> 02:18:23.550
Brian Nguyen: That basis.

2292
02:18:24.390 --> 02:18:26.040
Brian Nguyen: You read that has been taken from blah.

2293
02:18:26.040 --> 02:18:26.460
Aakrsh: Blah.

2294
02:18:26.940 --> 02:18:27.960
Brian Nguyen: Do you want to change.

2295
02:18:28.020 --> 02:18:28.290
Aakrsh: These

2296
02:18:28.380 --> 02:18:31.140
Brian Nguyen: These data. Right. So it would be yes.

2297
02:18:31.230 --> 02:18:32.550
Aakrsh: Because we want to change the basis

2298
02:18:33.420 --> 02:18:33.900
For why

2299
02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:36.090
Brian Nguyen: They're in here.

2300
02:18:37.110 --> 02:18:37.680
Brian Nguyen: Now you can

2301
02:18:37.770 --> 02:18:40.260
Brian Nguyen: Type in BL you as your basis.

2302
02:18:40.260 --> 02:18:40.620
Brian Nguyen: Because I

2303
02:18:40.980 --> 02:18:47.430
Brian Nguyen: Think it's right. Right. So do you see that right when I press enter. We're going to change the basis

2304
02:18:50.190 --> 02:18:50.670
Brian Nguyen: On TV.

2305
02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:17.580
Yes.

2306
02:19:20.040 --> 02:19:24.030
Brian Nguyen: Okay, let's enter, enter again just reading some files.

2307
02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:27.090
Okay.

2308
02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:33.900
Brian Nguyen: Here we go. All right, and then star.

2309
02:19:34.830 --> 02:19:35.700
Brian Nguyen: Wars next window.

2310
02:19:37.410 --> 02:19:41.040
Brian Nguyen: Essentially using different career basis. We want to delete this.

2311
02:19:41.310 --> 02:19:41.580
Month.

2312
02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:45.030
So,

2313
02:19:46.140 --> 02:19:46.380
Aakrsh: Yeah.

2314
02:19:46.710 --> 02:19:49.200
Brian Nguyen: They're not the same. Generally, we want the basis

2315
02:19:49.410 --> 02:19:50.790
Brian Nguyen: And the very basis to be

2316
02:19:50.790 --> 02:19:51.240
Aakrsh: The game.

2317
02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:51.870
Okay.

2318
02:19:52.890 --> 02:19:53.160
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

2319
02:19:57.300 --> 02:19:57.810
Brian Nguyen: All right.

2320
02:19:58.260 --> 02:20:00.600
Brian Nguyen: Now we are regenerate our game.

2321
02:20:07.080 --> 02:20:07.650
Aakrsh: Good.

2322
02:20:13.830 --> 02:20:15.270
Brian Nguyen: You want to be here.

2323
02:20:28.350 --> 02:20:29.850
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so now. Yeah.

2324
02:20:29.940 --> 02:20:30.270
Brian Nguyen: So,

2325
02:20:30.330 --> 02:20:31.920
Brian Nguyen: Everything, all the parameters are

2326
02:20:31.950 --> 02:20:32.850
Aakrsh: Going to be the same.

2327
02:20:33.090 --> 02:20:34.320
Aakrsh: The retiring DSP.

2328
02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:35.580
Brian Nguyen: It will all be there already.

2329
02:20:39.510 --> 02:20:41.580
Aakrsh: So you see that everything's already there. So,

2330
02:20:41.580 --> 02:20:43.260
Brian Nguyen: You don't need to modify it right

2331
02:20:43.380 --> 02:20:44.970
Brian Nguyen: You're just continue on what you

2332
02:20:45.060 --> 02:20:47.670
Brian Nguyen: already created right and it goes back to stop.

2333
02:20:48.300 --> 02:20:49.620
Aakrsh: The only thing that we're missing.

2334
02:20:49.770 --> 02:20:50.670
Is the RI

2335
02:20:51.990 --> 02:20:52.410
Brian Nguyen: RI

2336
02:20:54.030 --> 02:20:54.450
Brian Nguyen: Enters

2337
02:20:56.520 --> 02:20:58.230
Brian Nguyen: missing some basis it right

2338
02:20:58.470 --> 02:21:00.600
Brian Nguyen: As Mr and Mrs actors regenerated.

2339
02:21:01.170 --> 02:21:01.500
Okay.

2340
02:21:04.500 --> 02:21:05.610
Brian Nguyen: All right, so you're done.

2341
02:21:06.360 --> 02:21:08.100
Brian Nguyen: Right, so you can use it just

2342
02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:12.210
Brian Nguyen: Returned the basis that star, you're done here, started again.

2343
02:21:13.410 --> 02:21:15.090
Aakrsh: All right, now let's

2344
02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:16.500
Brian Nguyen: Go.

2345
02:21:17.730 --> 02:21:19.560
Aakrsh: And you can check the control file to

2346
02:21:24.360 --> 02:21:25.740
Brian Nguyen: See you scroll up

2347
02:21:26.490 --> 02:21:27.270
Brian Nguyen: Or down to get

2348
02:21:27.660 --> 02:21:30.510
Brian Nguyen: Their club depth to FTP

2349
02:21:30.570 --> 02:21:31.650
Aakrsh: There's no okay

2350
02:21:33.120 --> 02:21:34.950
Brian Nguyen: Let's get out and then you can just leave on job.

2351
02:21:35.490 --> 02:21:35.910
Brian Nguyen: All right.

2352
02:21:36.840 --> 02:21:37.470
Brian Nguyen: All right.

2353
02:21:39.450 --> 02:21:40.140
Brian Nguyen: Alright, we're done.

2354
02:21:40.470 --> 02:21:40.920
Aakrsh: So you just

2355
02:21:41.310 --> 02:21:42.990
Aakrsh: stop sharing now so that's

2356
02:21:43.860 --> 02:21:45.960
Brian Nguyen: That's how you guys can troubleshoot okay

2357
02:21:47.010 --> 02:21:47.640
Aakrsh: All right, so

2358
02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:50.940
Brian Nguyen: You want to restart from like fresh, you could do that.

2359
02:21:52.080 --> 02:21:53.370
Aakrsh: You can always modify

2360
02:21:54.120 --> 02:21:55.980
Brian Nguyen: Your file. Okay.

2361
02:21:57.660 --> 02:21:58.320
Brian Nguyen: All right.

2362
02:21:59.370 --> 02:22:04.290
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so now I'm going to go on to our next topic we're actually going

2363
02:22:05.550 --> 02:22:06.000
Brian Nguyen: To

2364
02:22:07.050 --> 02:22:07.890
Brian Nguyen: Before we move on.

2365
02:22:08.520 --> 02:22:09.630

Brian Nguyen: Alright, so I want you guys to

2367
02:22:17.250 --> 02:22:19.320
Brian Nguyen: Get to get the calculation running and

02:22:19.320 --> 02:22:22.740
Brian Nguyen: Finish it for Friday W sourcing little over

2369
02:22:23.070 --> 02:22:25.410
Brian Nguyen: Friday morning and there was my analyze

2370
02:22:25.590 --> 02:22:26.820
Brian Nguyen: The data. Okay.

2371
02:22:28.680 --> 02:22:30.360
Brian Nguyen: All right, and then

2372
02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:32.970
Brian Nguyen: Our next topic Luna talked about it.

2373
02:22:33.270 --> 02:22:34.470
Brian Nguyen: A little bit more chemistry stuff.

2374
02:22:34.950 --> 02:22:36.960
Brian Nguyen: All right, we may end up

2375
02:22:37.860 --> 02:22:39.360
Brian Nguyen: Working on it on our own.

2376
02:22:39.780 --> 02:22:42.000
Aakrsh: Written some calculations on our own. Okay.

2377
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:44.640
Brian Nguyen: So I

2378
02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:46.770
Brian Nguyen: Gave you guys

Aakrsh: It opens up for you.

2395
02:23:31.920 --> 02:23:34.260
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so I have this file for Internet

Brian Nguyen: Geometry.

2400
02:23:44.820 --> 02:23:46.200
Aakrsh: For a bunch of molecules.

2401
02:23:48.480 --> 02:23:50.880
Brian Nguyen: These are things I've already pre optimized.

2402
02:23:51.870 --> 02:23:53.550
Brian Nguyen: And what we're interested in.

2403
02:23:54.810 --> 02:23:57.000
Brian Nguyen: Is I'll probably open up

2404
02:23:57.330 --> 02:23:58.260
Avocado.

2405
02:24:19.650 --> 02:24:20.070
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

2406
02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:23.040
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

2407
02:24:23.460 --> 02:24:26.700
Brian Nguyen: Here's the topic. This is called inner molecular

2408
02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:28.710
Brian Nguyen: Forces. Okay.

2409
02:24:31.890 --> 02:24:35.370
Brian Nguyen: You guys have shown me sample where are some examples of

2410
02:24:35.370 --> 02:24:36.630
Aakrsh: internal forces.

2411
02:24:38.220 --> 02:24:41.880
Aakrsh: In one dispersion nine dispersion, yes.

2412
02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:42.540
What else

2413
02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:45.990
Aakrsh: dipole dipole dipole

2414
02:24:46.500 --> 02:24:46.800
And

2415
02:24:48.030 --> 02:24:50.130
Aakrsh: I didn't bonds. Hydrogen bonds.

2416
02:24:50.550 --> 02:24:54.090
Brian Nguyen: Okay. So three things we're going to look at. Okay.

2417
02:24:55.440 --> 02:24:57.000
Brian Nguyen: An example, hydrogen bonding.

2418
02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:03.300
Brian Nguyen: Water right

2419
02:25:04.860 --> 02:25:07.950
Aakrsh: Interaction between this hygiene with oxygen.

2420
02:25:08.220 --> 02:25:08.460
Aakrsh: That

2421
02:25:08.490 --> 02:25:09.270
Hydrogen bonding.

2422
02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:13.710
Brian Nguyen: Now, this version.

2423
02:25:15.210 --> 02:25:15.840
Aakrsh: Interaction

2424
02:25:17.310 --> 02:25:23.760
Aakrsh: So these are two different molecules. Right. So this is the effing interacting with each other's and this is a water molecule.

2425
02:25:23.850 --> 02:25:26.550
Brian Nguyen: interact with each other right so

2426
02:25:27.720 --> 02:25:28.380
Brian Nguyen: Generally

2427
02:25:28.710 --> 02:25:32.850
Brian Nguyen: We, we say that hygiene bonding is stronger than

2428
02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:34.320
Aakrsh: Dispersion contractions.

2429
02:25:34.680 --> 02:25:35.070
Correct.

2430
02:25:36.120 --> 02:25:36.540
Right, yeah.

2431
02:25:37.950 --> 02:25:38.280
Brian Nguyen: So,

2432
02:25:39.780 --> 02:25:41.580
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so before we start, so

2433
02:25:42.150 --> 02:25:42.810
Aakrsh: What

2434
02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:44.550
Brian Nguyen: Can you name me all the intimate with

2435
02:25:44.550 --> 02:25:45.540
Aakrsh: Forces between

2436
02:25:45.870 --> 02:25:46.920
Brian Nguyen: To water molecule.

2437
02:25:52.950 --> 02:25:53.670
Brian Nguyen: tongue in cheek.

2438
02:25:54.030 --> 02:25:54.630
Brian Nguyen: Answer that

2439
02:26:03.960 --> 02:26:04.440
thanh: Sorry.

2440
02:26:05.310 --> 02:26:07.740
Brian Nguyen: Okay, what what internal forces.

2441
02:26:08.250 --> 02:26:11.040
Brian Nguyen: Are between these two.

2442
02:26:12.060 --> 02:26:12.960
Brian Nguyen: Water molecules.

2443
02:26:13.950 --> 02:26:14.910
thanh: dipole dipole

2444
02:26:15.630 --> 02:26:16.050
Yes.

2445
02:26:17.430 --> 02:26:17.820
Aakrsh: Thank you.

2446
02:26:29.460 --> 02:26:30.360
Brian Nguyen: Pontypool

2447
02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:34.590
Brian Nguyen: Dispersion Virginia and

2448
02:26:35.130 --> 02:26:35.550
Brian Nguyen: What else

2449
02:26:35.970 --> 02:26:36.840
Brian Nguyen: And you know I

2450
02:26:37.860 --> 02:26:38.460
Aakrsh: hadn't gone

2451
02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:40.320
Aakrsh: Yeah.

2452
02:26:40.410 --> 02:26:42.240
Brian Nguyen: At him but they had all three.

2453
02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:43.440
Brian Nguyen: Components. Okay.

2454
02:26:45.300 --> 02:26:46.560
Brian Nguyen: Interesting because

2455
02:26:47.250 --> 02:26:57.180
Brian Nguyen: You know, interactive forces, you know, include all possible interactions. Right. And so for anything. The only interaction. You guys have here.

2456
02:26:57.960 --> 02:26:58.440
Aakrsh: Is

2457
02:26:58.590 --> 02:26:59.220
Brian Nguyen: This version.

2458
02:26:59.790 --> 02:27:01.830
Brian Nguyen: Right, there's no dipole dipole

2459
02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:04.290
Brian Nguyen: Things like that. Right.

2460
02:27:05.070 --> 02:27:05.730
Brian Nguyen: But the thing is,

2461
02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:08.220
Brian Nguyen: Now we're may be interested in

2462
02:27:08.820 --> 02:27:09.690
Brian Nguyen: The overall

2463
02:27:09.810 --> 02:27:11.040
Brian Nguyen: We can use our calculation.

2464
02:27:11.550 --> 02:27:12.570
Brian Nguyen: On a computer to

2465
02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:14.580
Brian Nguyen: binding energies of these molecules.

2466
02:27:16.350 --> 02:27:20.130
Brian Nguyen: And so the question we're going to try to answer or ask is,

2467
02:27:22.140 --> 02:27:24.360
Brian Nguyen: Think ahead and maybe question is

2468
02:27:24.450 --> 02:27:26.010
Brian Nguyen: How does cooperatives at

2469
02:27:28.470 --> 02:27:30.180
Brian Nguyen: How this cool opportunity.

2470
02:27:31.890 --> 02:27:32.850
Brian Nguyen: Contribute to the

2471
02:27:34.800 --> 02:27:36.690
Brian Nguyen: Cotton Club Katie of the naka de

2472
02:27:36.690 --> 02:27:37.560
Aakrsh: Interactions.

2473
02:27:37.650 --> 02:27:38.790
Brian Nguyen: Are the forces.

2474
02:27:42.300 --> 02:27:43.230
Brian Nguyen: Contribute to the

2475
02:27:43.650 --> 02:27:45.480
Brian Nguyen: Overall findings.

2476
02:27:49.230 --> 02:27:49.740
Aakrsh: The what

2477
02:27:51.540 --> 02:27:52.710
Brian Nguyen: The current activity.

2478
02:27:54.540 --> 02:27:56.910
Brian Nguyen: The like how does the. How does

2479
02:27:56.970 --> 02:27:57.420
You know,

2480
02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:00.390
Brian Nguyen: How does the size

2481
02:28:00.450 --> 02:28:00.870
Brian Nguyen: You know,

2482
02:28:01.050 --> 02:28:01.620
Brian Nguyen: Of your

2483
02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:03.210
Brian Nguyen: Your molecules.

2484
02:28:03.390 --> 02:28:06.060
Brian Nguyen: Can affect the binding energy

2485
02:28:07.230 --> 02:28:07.560
Brian Nguyen: So,

2486
02:28:07.620 --> 02:28:08.250
Aakrsh: The larger

2487
02:28:11.370 --> 02:28:17.160
Aakrsh: The larger the molecule, the more the more polarized bold is so it's no longer like

2488
02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:21.540
Brian Nguyen: Yes that's true polarized ability will be related

2489
02:28:21.720 --> 02:28:22.590
Brian Nguyen: London Dispersion.

2490
02:28:23.340 --> 02:28:30.300
Brian Nguyen: So it's sometimes the whole thing that we're kind of thinking about hydrogen bonding.

2491
02:28:31.170 --> 02:28:33.900
Brian Nguyen: Like it really isn't an isolated.

2492
02:28:34.170 --> 02:28:36.540
Brian Nguyen: Interaction. There's a bunch of other interactions.

2493
02:28:36.750 --> 02:28:39.000
Brian Nguyen: That contributes to the overall financial

2494
02:28:39.570 --> 02:28:39.870
Aakrsh: Right.

2495
02:28:40.740 --> 02:28:43.020
Brian Nguyen: And so if you have a very large

2496
02:28:43.350 --> 02:28:43.920
Brian Nguyen: You know, like

2497
02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:46.800
Brian Nguyen: Ideas that you have a very large

2498
02:28:48.510 --> 02:28:49.650
Brian Nguyen: That a molecule here.

2499
02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:52.770
Aakrsh: You like to say just chain of carbons.

2500
02:28:53.160 --> 02:28:55.470
Brian Nguyen: Up to second 10 or more right

2501
02:28:56.880 --> 02:28:57.180
Brian Nguyen: That

2502
02:28:57.240 --> 02:28:58.290
Aakrsh: That interaction.

2503
02:28:58.950 --> 02:28:59.910
Brian Nguyen: And be stronger.

2504
02:29:00.240 --> 02:29:02.400
Brian Nguyen: Than the binding energy of your water molecule.

2505
02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:04.050
Brian Nguyen: And then we can try to see that.

2506
02:29:04.080 --> 02:29:04.260
Aakrsh: In

2507
02:29:04.500 --> 02:29:06.330
Aakrsh: In our calculation. Okay.

2508
02:29:08.100 --> 02:29:08.460
Brian Nguyen: So,

2509
02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:13.140
Brian Nguyen: I have a few other examples to interesting chemistry to

2510
02:29:16.650 --> 02:29:17.760
Aakrsh: So what we're going to

2511
02:29:17.790 --> 02:29:23.100
Brian Nguyen: Try to do is to meet open up some of the molecules. So this is another one too.

2512
02:29:25.980 --> 02:29:28.890
Brian Nguyen: The benzene dimer. All right.

2513
02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.040
Aakrsh: I'm gonna try to open up some articles.

2514
02:29:32.130 --> 02:29:33.090
Aakrsh: You guys can see it.

2515
02:29:40.740 --> 02:29:42.330
Brian Nguyen: On this one more. Oh, shoot.

2516
02:29:43.020 --> 02:29:43.380
Okay.

2517
02:29:44.880 --> 02:29:45.150
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

2518
02:29:46.980 --> 02:29:48.780
Brian Nguyen: Right, so we have this century here.

2519
02:29:50.310 --> 02:29:50.640
Brian Nguyen: Right.

2520
02:29:57.540 --> 02:29:58.890
Brian Nguyen: Right, you have this bending dimer.

2521
02:30:00.510 --> 02:30:01.950
Brian Nguyen: What's very interesting here.

2522
02:30:02.310 --> 02:30:03.750
Brian Nguyen: Is that you have this

2523
02:30:04.080 --> 02:30:05.310
Brian Nguyen: Tiny energy here.

2524
02:30:05.640 --> 02:30:07.860
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so we're gonna take a look at three different

2525
02:30:07.860 --> 02:30:08.640
Molecules.

2526
02:30:10.380 --> 02:30:12.180
Aakrsh: And open up one more.

2527
02:30:15.870 --> 02:30:16.590
Is this word, yes.

2528
02:30:17.850 --> 02:30:18.510
Brian Nguyen: But so, yes.

2529
02:30:19.830 --> 02:30:20.250
Brian Nguyen: All right.

2530
02:30:20.730 --> 02:30:22.500
Aakrsh: Should we have this structure here.

2531
02:30:24.240 --> 02:30:25.830
Brian Nguyen: And I believe you have

2532
02:30:28.050 --> 02:30:30.510
Brian Nguyen: This structure here. All right.

2533
02:30:32.010 --> 02:30:35.850
Brian Nguyen: And if you were to stay hypothesize

2534
02:30:37.140 --> 02:30:38.640
Aakrsh: Which one do you think

2535
02:30:39.210 --> 02:30:41.460
Brian Nguyen: Which molecules you think has a stronger binding.

2536
02:30:45.150 --> 02:30:46.470
Brian Nguyen: Yet T shaped

2537
02:30:47.580 --> 02:30:48.390
Brian Nguyen: Versus this

2538
02:30:49.170 --> 02:30:49.830
Brian Nguyen: Stack shape.

2539
02:30:53.190 --> 02:30:53.640
Brian Nguyen: Well, yes.

2540
02:30:58.170 --> 02:30:58.740
Brian Nguyen: Are you guys ready

2541
02:31:00.930 --> 02:31:02.760
Brian Nguyen: Yet to see safe molecule here.

2542
02:31:10.050 --> 02:31:12.270
Aakrsh: And they have this stack right

2543
02:31:12.300 --> 02:31:13.470
Brian Nguyen: Our they are more

2544
02:31:13.590 --> 02:31:14.490
Brian Nguyen: On top of each other.

2545
02:31:14.670 --> 02:31:23.550
Aakrsh: Essentially, I'm monifieth this one because you can because like you can ladder and I'll talk to each other. It'll have stronger like attraction to each other.

2546
02:31:25.170 --> 02:31:30.270
Brian Nguyen: Mm hmm. Okay, that's when answer. Anyone else want to hear.

2547
02:31:31.290 --> 02:31:31.950
Brian Nguyen: But in the vote.

2548
02:31:41.730 --> 02:31:43.200
Victoria Choi: I think the sun to

2549
02:31:46.680 --> 02:31:46.710
Theresa Carlos: A

2550
02:31:48.810 --> 02:31:49.290
Tee sheet.

2551
02:31:57.450 --> 02:31:57.840
Aakrsh: That

2552
02:31:58.260 --> 02:31:59.670
Brian Nguyen: That few people voting for this.

2553
02:31:59.910 --> 02:32:00.300
Deck.

2554
02:32:01.710 --> 02:32:03.570
thanh: While ago i think that someone to

2555
02:32:04.350 --> 02:32:04.800
Okay.

2556
02:32:05.850 --> 02:32:06.120
Brian Nguyen: Very

2557
02:32:07.890 --> 02:32:08.280
Brian Nguyen: Good. You're thinking

2558
02:32:10.200 --> 02:32:12.810
Brian Nguyen: Yep. Okay. So this is a reasonable get

2559
02:32:14.070 --> 02:32:14.880
Brian Nguyen: A very reasonable.

2560
02:32:15.630 --> 02:32:16.080
That

2561
02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:18.210
Brian Nguyen: You know that

2562
02:32:18.990 --> 02:32:20.190
Brian Nguyen: It overlaps a lot

2563
02:32:21.510 --> 02:32:22.680
Brian Nguyen: That they will bind

2564
02:32:22.950 --> 02:32:25.290
Brian Nguyen: It will be the ground state energy of this

2565
02:32:25.410 --> 02:32:28.260
Brian Nguyen: is complex and may have a stronger binding.

2566
02:32:29.700 --> 02:32:30.390
Aakrsh: However,

2567
02:32:31.950 --> 02:32:35.190
Aakrsh: This is a little bit more complicated even gotten to see

2568
02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:36.660
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so

2569
02:32:38.220 --> 02:32:41.580
Brian Nguyen: So this one is what we call staggered. Okay.

2570
02:32:42.960 --> 02:32:50.520
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so if we add one more example where like if I had this completely

2571
02:32:52.470 --> 02:32:53.160
Brian Nguyen: You know the

2572
02:32:54.570 --> 02:33:00.060
Brian Nguyen: I had to completely over say complete on top of it to say,

2573
02:33:01.380 --> 02:33:04.860
Brian Nguyen: You think that will increase that will, you know, increase the bindi

2574
02:33:07.020 --> 02:33:10.890
Brian Nguyen: Say like completely that basically look at this is complete overlays. Right.

2575
02:33:14.100 --> 02:33:17.550
Brian Nguyen: Right. Okay, so now we're busy on top of each other.

2576
02:33:18.630 --> 02:33:31.980
Brian Nguyen: Right. So, based on what you just, you know, if he said that, you know, if we have more overlap, maybe there would be more finding right energy they embody the engine increases in that it will be the ground state of that molecule.

2577
02:33:34.590 --> 02:33:37.800
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so we're going to try to figure out answer that question.

2578
02:33:38.970 --> 02:33:56.280
Brian Nguyen: But actually this I will actually give you kind of paper. They've already started trying to explain this. Right. And what they found is that this second. Here we see the complete overlay right on top of each other. It's not the ground state.

2579
02:33:58.380 --> 02:34:03.240
Brian Nguyen: Right. It's not the ground state, it is it has a weaker binding energy

2580
02:34:05.730 --> 02:34:07.950
Brian Nguyen: Then the staggered

2581
02:34:10.740 --> 02:34:12.180
Brian Nguyen: In a staggered a vengeance.

2582
02:34:13.290 --> 02:34:17.340
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so say you stagger it a little bit like right here.

2583
02:34:20.940 --> 02:34:27.840
Brian Nguyen: This one is close. This is a much more stable molecule in this completely overlaid

2584
02:34:29.070 --> 02:34:34.920
Brian Nguyen: Then add a monocle crazy ass right now he's he's not a twitch.

2585
02:34:38.160 --> 02:34:48.600
Brian Nguyen: If you were to compare it this T shaped versus that completely overlaid overlap the vending. Which one do you think is stronger in mining, which ones more stable. Yes.

2586
02:34:52.620 --> 02:35:07.290
Brian Nguyen: I think we also say we said that the the argument is a is complete overlaid it will should be more stable. However, actually the key shape is more stable than the stack the end

2587
02:35:10.500 --> 02:35:19.950
Brian Nguyen: And they attributed to dispersion direction. Right. And so it just, it just shows you how dispersion traction are very complicated to understand

2588
02:35:20.910 --> 02:35:29.340
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so right now they're in contention. They're trying to date between which one is a true ground state. So right now, the debate is eternal destruction.

2589
02:35:30.750 --> 02:35:32.460
Brian Nguyen: Or destructive. Okay.

2590
02:35:33.750 --> 02:35:35.880
Brian Nguyen: And so what we're going to do is you want to try to verify

2591
02:35:38.220 --> 02:35:47.640
Brian Nguyen: Verify that interaction verified the result on the paper. I'll pass on that paper to you guys, take a look at to read. Okay.

2592
02:35:50.190 --> 02:35:55.650
Brian Nguyen: So we, we will would kind of verify the will try to verify the the

2593
02:35:57.570 --> 02:36:01.860
Brian Nguyen: The conclusions by actually competing divine the energy. Alright.

2594
02:36:03.900 --> 02:36:06.660
Brian Nguyen: To explain why. So

2595
02:36:07.680 --> 02:36:10.920
Brian Nguyen: That will be requiring a little bit more work. And that's what we're

2596
02:36:11.940 --> 02:36:22.260
Brian Nguyen: That's what our group tried to try to try to try to explore, okay, we're trying to explain why. So happening, you know, why are the numbers so and so. Okay.

2597
02:36:23.700 --> 02:36:35.550
Brian Nguyen: All right, so yeah, so we don't know much about non Canadian direction and, you know, even though with our intuition chemistry intuition. You can be something very wrong. Right. Okay.

2598
02:36:36.600 --> 02:36:40.440
Brian Nguyen: I think I have to get back to you guys.

2599
02:36:41.910 --> 02:36:43.680
Brian Nguyen: On the molecules of self.

2600
02:36:44.910 --> 02:36:51.270
Brian Nguyen: Because I think I didn't give you the correct molecules. They don't look right. Sorry about that.

2601
02:36:52.350 --> 02:36:52.740
Brian Nguyen: So,

2602
02:36:54.480 --> 02:36:57.540
Brian Nguyen: So, uh, so what we're gonna do is we're gonna

2603
02:36:58.920 --> 02:37:03.360
Brian Nguyen: actually tried to compete. Some of these find the energy okay so

2604
02:37:04.710 --> 02:37:05.970
Brian Nguyen: You can do a very simple one.

2605
02:37:07.290 --> 02:37:14.370
Brian Nguyen: Will do the water diamonds. Okay, I know. That's correct. All right, so, so it's dark. Right. Alright, so

2606
02:37:15.690 --> 02:37:17.520
Brian Nguyen: So are we going to do first is

2607
02:37:18.600 --> 02:37:20.160
Brian Nguyen: We are going to open our terminal.

2608
02:37:21.210 --> 02:37:40.950
Brian Nguyen: Okay, this, this is in the we're in. I'm in my, in my new york computer when I log out. And then when Sep those structures structures. Okay, and I'll send you updated structures. Later on, because I think some of them are incorrect. Right. So to log out his Control D.

2609
02:37:42.270 --> 02:37:44.820
Brian Nguyen: OK, so now you see the connection is logged out

2610
02:37:46.500 --> 02:37:53.220
Brian Nguyen: All right, now I'm in the first high school outreach folder where I'm going to do is going to make a directory

2611
02:37:54.390 --> 02:37:55.710
Brian Nguyen: Will call this nautical valence

2612
02:37:58.650 --> 02:38:01.200
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so we have that folder now.

2613
02:38:02.700 --> 02:38:10.290
Brian Nguyen: Now we're going to go back to their home directory, just type in CD and oh for Windows. Be careful. Do not type in CD.

2614
02:38:12.150 --> 02:38:14.220
Brian Nguyen: It goes back to your and mounted

2615
02:38:15.720 --> 02:38:25.620
Brian Nguyen: Home directory. OK, so I'll be careful. Actually, I went through this is the double period, whatever. And we want to go into downloads. So that's where

2616
02:38:27.990 --> 02:38:31.050
Brian Nguyen: I put the folder call for interns.

2617
02:38:32.340 --> 02:38:32.790
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

2618
02:38:34.650 --> 02:38:37.500
Brian Nguyen: We can then move this for interns.

2619
02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:41.550
Brian Nguyen: Back and put that

2620
02:38:42.570 --> 02:38:59.190
Brian Nguyen: Folder into the folder for the high school outreach. Okay, that depends on where you put that for me, I put in the document. So I'm just pointing this to the path where is alright so documents for nice grow rich and and not completely

2621
02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:07.620
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so, um, we'll back documents crash now.

2622
02:39:10.800 --> 02:39:11.250
Brian Nguyen: All right.

2623
02:39:12.630 --> 02:39:12.990
Brian Nguyen: There.

2624
02:39:16.140 --> 02:39:19.890
Brian Nguyen: Stop right here briefly want to see everyone got to the stage.

2625
02:39:29.070 --> 02:39:32.520
Brian Nguyen: Give me a thumbs up or not. And you guys got it.

2626
02:39:34.500 --> 02:39:36.180
Brian Nguyen: Okay, Chris, you got to speak.

2627
02:39:38.580 --> 02:39:45.030
Brian Nguyen: Con not yes good three center to Korea and he has Windows. So it's a little bit tricky.

2628
02:39:46.020 --> 02:39:48.450
Theresa Carlos: Yeah, let's see you soon.

2629
02:39:52.020 --> 02:39:55.050
Brian Nguyen: Okay. Okay, so you can share me your screen with me.

2630
02:40:24.450 --> 02:40:32.880
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so you see that error de de de de right now if he didn't put a space. That's fine. I do LS

2631
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:42.660
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so I believe you downloaded the file right for intern file.

2632
02:40:44.310 --> 02:40:49.470
Brian Nguyen: Okay, now let's go into download PDF download SVG where all your files are

2633
02:40:52.350 --> 02:40:52.740
Brian Nguyen: Ls

2634
02:40:55.800 --> 02:40:56.370
Brian Nguyen: Oh, right.

2635
02:40:57.870 --> 02:40:58.290
Brian Nguyen: For it.

2636
02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:06.750
Brian Nguyen: So the zip file. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna have to do a command called and yet.

2637
02:41:14.070 --> 02:41:15.090
Brian Nguyen: For interns.

2638
02:41:23.250 --> 02:41:25.230
Brian Nguyen: Underscore should be. Nope. Nope.

2639
02:41:39.780 --> 02:41:44.010
Brian Nguyen: Nope. So what happened is that the program is not there. So that's installed that copy

2640
02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:45.750
Brian Nguyen: And

2641
02:42:00.780 --> 02:42:08.460
Brian Nguyen: Paste in here to type, type it out. I guess you do app install on just, yeah. Sorry.

2642
02:42:09.810 --> 02:42:14.250
Brian Nguyen: Windows festival. Now this is the password that you use for this is going to

2643
02:42:15.450 --> 02:42:18.690
Brian Nguyen: Be unlocked. When you first created this account remember it.

2644
02:42:43.710 --> 02:42:44.310
Brian Nguyen: Oh, no.

2645
02:42:47.820 --> 02:42:48.120
Oh, no.

2646
02:42:49.860 --> 02:42:51.630
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, type in the app yet.

2647
02:42:58.470 --> 02:43:00.390
Brian Nguyen: Time Victoria to get it.

2648
02:43:16.770 --> 02:43:17.160
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

2649
02:43:17.940 --> 02:43:18.750
I'm

2650
02:43:21.180 --> 02:43:23.010
Brian Nguyen: Victoria. How do you unzip your file.

2651
02:43:24.420 --> 02:43:34.920
Victoria Choi: Um, I just did it through terminal. But if you go to your like actual computer and then go to the files folder. I think you can unzip it from there.

2652
02:43:36.180 --> 02:43:36.690
Brian Nguyen: That's true.

2653
02:43:38.250 --> 02:43:40.050
Brian Nguyen: Okay, they're doing a terminal.

2654
02:43:40.110 --> 02:43:40.290
Victoria Choi: Just

2655
02:43:40.470 --> 02:43:42.480
Brian Nguyen: Open it from your documents in

2656
02:43:46.110 --> 02:43:47.220
Brian Nguyen: OK, though.

2657
02:43:49.980 --> 02:43:53.490
Brian Nguyen: This move on to stop sharing I'll share mine now.

2658
02:43:57.240 --> 02:44:00.390
Brian Nguyen: All right, so. All right, so

2659
02:44:01.830 --> 02:44:05.760
Brian Nguyen: That's three zero wer come back I'll get back to you on it. All right, so

2660
02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:09.690
Brian Nguyen: When did the same thing SAP this file.

2661
02:44:11.070 --> 02:44:11.430
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

2662
02:44:12.990 --> 02:44:13.740
Brian Nguyen: Your computer

2663
02:44:25.050 --> 02:44:25.920
Brian Nguyen: Period skipped one

2664
02:44:33.270 --> 02:44:41.640
Brian Nguyen: So there's this structures. I'm gonna send you updated structure. I think a few of them were incorrect I'll double check. I know the water is correct. Okay.

2665
02:44:43.860 --> 02:44:45.210
Brian Nguyen: Well then log into the computer.

2666
02:44:54.630 --> 02:44:58.680
Brian Nguyen: Okay, we're gonna move that file and non prevent IRC here.

2667
02:45:00.090 --> 02:45:00.960
Brian Nguyen: To your quarter.

2668
02:45:02.670 --> 02:45:03.030
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

2669
02:45:04.350 --> 02:45:05.820
Brian Nguyen: Your username. Alright.

2670
02:45:09.630 --> 02:45:11.490
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so let's go into the work order.

2671
02:45:15.480 --> 02:45:16.800
Brian Nguyen: So we had a non cavaillon

2672
02:45:18.540 --> 02:45:22.860
Brian Nguyen: Right, you got for insurance right so what we're gonna do is

2673
02:45:24.180 --> 02:45:38.220
Brian Nguyen: We're going to compute the binding energy for these molecules. Alright, we're use what we learned us define and then we're going to use a slightly different command. Okay. So to that everyone's going to be consistent.

2674
02:45:40.710 --> 02:45:55.530
Brian Nguyen: So that everyone has the same field, right. So, because I've always I supposedly I have already optimized these structures to be the true ground state. And on Friday, we can try to see if I did a good job doing that. Okay.

2675
02:45:56.820 --> 02:45:58.440
Brian Nguyen: They will make a directory called water.

2676
02:45:59.880 --> 02:46:01.350
Brian Nguyen: Okay, we

2677
02:46:01.800 --> 02:46:02.820
Brian Nguyen: Go, yes.

2678
02:46:03.750 --> 02:46:07.590
Aakrsh: What's the first thing you do. After you log into the UCI computer

2679
02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:15.990
Brian Nguyen: Copies of files and all of that file into the computer. Do you want to work with right here.

2680
02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:18.510
Brian Nguyen: Yeah.

2681
02:46:19.410 --> 02:46:25.590
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, okay. I use the colon period to copy into the home directory

2682
02:46:26.070 --> 02:46:29.100
Aakrsh: But you have to be any work to do that for me do that outside of work.

2683
02:46:31.050 --> 02:46:37.590
Brian Nguyen: To to run the calculation itself, you should be in work like a coffee and stuff. You can you can do this. Me show you

2684
02:46:39.150 --> 02:46:43.530
Brian Nguyen: You can type in this Sep dash are the smile.

2685
02:46:45.660 --> 02:46:46.560
Brian Nguyen: At the user

2686
02:46:47.790 --> 02:46:50.220
Brian Nguyen: The computer or computer that is

2687
02:46:51.570 --> 02:47:07.500
Brian Nguyen: Colon, now it's disco. And this means that you're just pointing it to a directory or wherever you want to do. So I needed a little bit easier. So you guys to disperse period. But as you guys learn more and try to speak up, understand this, you can actually laid out to work.

2688
02:47:09.900 --> 02:47:17.790
Brian Nguyen: If you know where your we want to put it. Okay. So, this essentially will copy that file to that directory. OK.

2689
02:47:18.960 --> 02:47:21.570
Brian Nguyen: So I'm going to Control. See you guys can

2690
02:47:23.280 --> 02:47:23.670
Brian Nguyen: See this

2691
02:47:24.420 --> 02:47:25.920
Aakrsh: file or directory them for me.

2692
02:47:28.350 --> 02:47:39.360
Brian Nguyen: So there are two options. One is that the computer, you have does not have this folder here so it can't copy it directly there.

2693
02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:47.790
Brian Nguyen: So the best safe bet is to just do a period, it will always copy home directory and you can access that all the time. Okay.

2694
02:47:49.860 --> 02:48:09.720
Brian Nguyen: Just keep in mind to work folder corresponds to the computer you using. All right, like the like locally, your, your depth here, add on to that computer, not the server. Okay. The home directory is extra server and you can save your files. Right. And that's this is where any computer UCI

2695
02:48:11.640 --> 02:48:17.640
Brian Nguyen: Right, so you want to compute go into water, we're actually going to be using

2696
02:48:18.660 --> 02:48:26.190
Brian Nguyen: Make a directory will call a piece of H dash corporatist do underscored easy. Okay.

2697
02:48:27.750 --> 02:48:46.110
Brian Nguyen: D3 is the extra parameters we want to add to allow us to compute very accurate by the energy. Okay. I'll explain that later maybe maybe tomorrow if you attend office hours. But for now, this is the parameter. Do you need to compute engine luck with washes accurately. Okay.

2698
02:48:47.970 --> 02:48:54.330
Brian Nguyen: Will do the same thing. PBS st three right in January. Want to flee the fuse.

2699
02:48:57.120 --> 02:48:59.400
Brian Nguyen: Death to PvP

2700
02:49:01.530 --> 02:49:04.080
Brian Nguyen: For designing energy recounting need

2701
02:49:05.310 --> 02:49:07.500
Brian Nguyen: Separate basis it. Okay.

2702
02:49:13.350 --> 02:49:14.250
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so

2703
02:49:17.580 --> 02:49:18.780
Brian Nguyen: Alright so what we're gonna do.

2704
02:49:20.220 --> 02:49:24.960
Brian Nguyen: Is we're gonna get take her water dimer.

2705
02:49:27.420 --> 02:49:27.900
Up.

2706
02:49:31.980 --> 02:49:32.310
Alright.

2707
02:49:34.320 --> 02:49:35.820
Brian Nguyen: We have the water diamond.

2708
02:49:37.110 --> 02:49:37.560
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

2709
02:49:41.970 --> 02:49:44.610
Brian Nguyen: All right, we'll go through the same steps.

2710
02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:57.990
Brian Nguyen: Alright, that's fine. We'll run through define

2711
02:50:03.450 --> 02:50:06.240
Brian Nguyen: Go through the same steps again a court.

2712
02:50:08.910 --> 02:50:14.310
Brian Nguyen: cemeteries and add this is not so that's okay maybe add I read

2713
02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:16.830
Brian Nguyen: Star.

2714
02:50:19.230 --> 02:50:20.040
Brian Nguyen: Check our basis.

2715
02:50:21.900 --> 02:50:23.340
Brian Nguyen: Yes, he brings up

2716
02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:27.600
Brian Nguyen: Whereas we don't actually do deputies to

2717
02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:30.840
Brian Nguyen: Check that

2718
02:50:33.210 --> 02:50:33.720
Brian Nguyen: We've known

2719
02:50:35.250 --> 02:50:38.850
Brian Nguyen: ght regenerate our molecular orbital our initial gift.

2720
02:50:39.990 --> 02:50:40.350
It is

2721
02:50:41.430 --> 02:50:48.090
Brian Nguyen: Just neutral. Yeah, looks bizarre observation and there's no warranty, not too much good.

2722
02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:51.360
Brian Nguyen: Go to DSP.

2723
02:50:52.710 --> 02:50:53.700
Brian Nguyen: Need to turn these on.

2724
02:50:55.260 --> 02:50:55.680
Brian Nguyen: Type in

2725
02:50:57.360 --> 02:50:58.140
Brian Nguyen: GPS is a

2726
02:51:00.570 --> 02:51:00.960
Brian Nguyen: Star.

2727
02:51:02.430 --> 02:51:03.330
Brian Nguyen: Turn our eyes.

2728
02:51:06.480 --> 02:51:07.770
Brian Nguyen: Okay, dar again.

2729
02:51:08.940 --> 02:51:12.180
Brian Nguyen: And Asia. This is a nice little different is an important

2730
02:51:13.500 --> 02:51:14.610
Brian Nguyen: DSP.

2731
02:51:15.960 --> 02:51:18.870
Brian Nguyen: For DSP dispersion correction.

2732
02:51:19.890 --> 02:51:25.080
Brian Nguyen: Okay, very important is is will be needed to get accurate finances. So the SP.

2733
02:51:26.640 --> 02:51:31.530
Brian Nguyen: I've been BJ to the one we want to use and use this version. Okay.

2734
02:51:34.290 --> 02:51:36.780
Brian Nguyen: And once it says us right here.

2735
02:51:39.090 --> 02:51:40.620
Brian Nguyen: So again,

2736
02:51:46.410 --> 02:51:46.800
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

2737
02:51:48.390 --> 02:51:50.250
Brian Nguyen: Real quick, guys.

2738
02:51:52.140 --> 02:51:55.770
Brian Nguyen: Good here. All right, so last thing we want to do.

2739
02:51:56.970 --> 02:52:01.650
Brian Nguyen: Is to r i t to our ideas.

2740
02:52:05.430 --> 02:52:09.240
Brian Nguyen: We're going to generate put no hub so that you can run this in the background.

2741
02:52:14.940 --> 02:52:17.730
Brian Nguyen: It takes some time. So, oh yeah well

2742
02:52:19.980 --> 02:52:47.070
Brian Nguyen: Alright so what r i t is t does the guys know is that it takes to do you have a given geometry. All right. And it computes the energy for that given geometry is not GMP optimization is essentially doing a single point energy calculation. So maybe an example maybe explain this on a whiteboard.

2743
02:52:50.130 --> 02:52:50.940
Let me

2744
02:52:51.990 --> 02:52:52.770
Brian Nguyen: Clear this

2745
02:52:55.020 --> 02:52:58.560
Brian Nguyen: So imagine you have a surface.

2746
02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:01.590
Brian Nguyen: Right. I know.

2747
02:53:03.090 --> 02:53:07.170
Brian Nguyen: I know I. Good. So imagine you have surface.

2748
02:53:10.800 --> 02:53:11.100
Okay.

2749
02:53:13.260 --> 02:53:14.370
Brian Nguyen: Each of these points.

2750
02:53:16.140 --> 02:53:16.470
Brian Nguyen: Here.

2751
02:53:18.180 --> 02:53:18.690
Brian Nguyen: Here.

2752
02:53:20.130 --> 02:53:33.600
Brian Nguyen: Are some configuration of your, your molecule, right. Some orientation of the weight Adams or range. All right. And so what what geometry optimization. Does this say you start

2753
02:53:34.980 --> 02:53:35.430
Brian Nguyen: Here.

2754
02:53:37.080 --> 02:53:57.240
Brian Nguyen: What geometry optimization tried to do it tries to find you a minimum. Okay. And so it would compete the energy in modified to the atoms rearranged a little bit and then you and you may end up being in this location. All right, we call a well alright

2755
02:53:58.770 --> 02:54:05.850
Brian Nguyen: So what we're doing here. Given a configuration. We're just competing the energy

2756
02:54:06.930 --> 02:54:16.350
Brian Nguyen: Alright, and we're going to use that energy to compute are buying the energy. Okay, so this is a total energy. So the formula.

2757
02:54:17.640 --> 02:54:18.810
Brian Nguyen: For finding energy

2758
02:54:24.510 --> 02:54:26.490
Brian Nguyen: Alright, this is the formula.

2759
02:54:31.770 --> 02:54:33.300
Brian Nguyen: For our formula.

2760
02:54:34.560 --> 02:54:35.430
Brian Nguyen: We are

2761
02:54:37.050 --> 02:54:39.150
Brian Nguyen: Going to use this equation here.

2762
02:54:42.060 --> 02:54:43.830
Brian Nguyen: So he is our total energy

2763
02:54:46.500 --> 02:54:54.150
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so where we're going to do is take root causes del there's a difference and energy will be will stand for

2764
02:54:55.620 --> 02:54:57.960
Brian Nguyen: Interest interaction dividing energy will equal

2765
02:55:00.480 --> 02:55:01.890
Brian Nguyen: The total energy

2766
02:55:05.160 --> 02:55:05.850
Brian Nguyen: Will call this

2767
02:55:07.050 --> 02:55:11.490
Brian Nguyen: Fragment is this called it monomers. A or fragment K

2768
02:55:14.100 --> 02:55:20.400
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so just for reference. So you guys kind of know what we're talking about. If you

2769
02:55:33.090 --> 02:55:33.390
Brian Nguyen: Right.

2770
02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:41.730
Brian Nguyen: All right, we'll call it

2771
02:55:44.280 --> 02:55:44.820
Brian Nguyen: A

2772
02:55:46.980 --> 02:55:47.910
Brian Nguyen: Call this week.

2773
02:55:53.400 --> 02:55:54.240
Brian Nguyen: Until

2774
02:55:57.540 --> 02:55:59.130
Brian Nguyen: The individual fragments

2775
02:56:07.980 --> 02:56:11.850
Brian Nguyen: Total energy of the complete complex, it's

2776
02:56:21.420 --> 02:56:23.580
Brian Nguyen: That clear how do we compete to find the energy

2777
02:56:27.810 --> 02:56:30.720
Brian Nguyen: So if you kind of just trying to think about it.

2778
02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:35.610
Brian Nguyen: We think about just completed the total area of a

2779
02:56:36.660 --> 02:56:37.770
Brian Nguyen: Until the end up

2780
02:56:38.910 --> 02:56:46.650
Brian Nguyen: Maybe subtract it from the energy of this whole complex right ideas to what stuff over. It's just finding energy

2781
02:56:48.570 --> 02:56:48.960
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

2782
02:56:52.800 --> 02:56:53.160
Brian Nguyen: All right.

2783
02:56:54.480 --> 02:56:56.190
Brian Nguyen: So stop sharing here.

2784
02:57:02.100 --> 02:57:05.160
Brian Nguyen: That's what we're going to probably doing on Friday. All right.

2785
02:57:06.390 --> 02:57:15.180
Brian Nguyen: So I will. I won't want to sign your homework for that one. But I can, I could be some other with that right so precursors for Friday.

2786
02:57:16.320 --> 02:57:30.420
Brian Nguyen: All right. Okay. I'll leave that they're not serious. Try gesture Pro. Are there questions so that we read this top 30 today we are essentially building upon what we just did.

2787
02:57:32.760 --> 02:57:47.070
Brian Nguyen: On Monday abashed commands. So try to keep practicing on that to get free food to it to the point where I don't need to, like, you know, remind you all that. Okay, and you can troubleshoot your own today was just kind of learn how to use several more

2788
02:57:48.300 --> 02:57:55.320
Brian Nguyen: Or dish on the parameters gift feel for it and that later on we work with mentors. Can I make a little bit since

2789
02:57:57.180 --> 02:58:02.580
Brian Nguyen: Friday, we will try to answer that chemistry question and then next week.

2790
02:58:03.690 --> 02:58:07.320
Brian Nguyen: When we start to finish up some things. One last thing to do. Alright.

2791
02:58:08.970 --> 02:58:11.640
Brian Nguyen: Alright, let's see, I have for you guys today.

2792
02:58:13.050 --> 02:58:15.720
Brian Nguyen: I went through pretty fast. Last section. So

2793
02:58:18.480 --> 02:58:20.850
Brian Nguyen: Thank you. Yeah, good.

2794
02:58:21.450 --> 02:58:23.460
Brian Nguyen: Good. Yeah. Thank you.

2795
02:58:27.030 --> 02:58:28.740
Brian Nguyen: Alright, see you guys.

2796
02:58:31.980 --> 02:58:32.460
Brian Nguyen: Friday.

2797
02:58:33.030 --> 02:58:36.810
Brian Nguyen: Or Thursday I have office hours tomorrow, so she'll be stopped by

2798
02:58:41.940 --> 02:58:44.340
Brian Nguyen: Teresa me stop this recording

2799
02:58:45.900 --> 02:58:46.230
Theresa Carlos: What

2800
02:58:47.490 --> 02:58:47.820
Brian Nguyen: Yeah.
