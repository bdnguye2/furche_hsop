1
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.340
Brian Nguyen: All right.

2
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.410
Brian Nguyen: At least we have one more, one more, one where it's going to show up.

3
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.100
Brian Nguyen: Wait for a few MIT.

4
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.540
Brian Nguyen: How's everyone's weekend.

5
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.900
Samuel Bekoe: Hey, can you guys hear me.

6
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.790
Brian Nguyen: If you can

7
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.040
Brian Nguyen: Kind of get started in

8
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.080
Brian Nguyen: May before we

9
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.370
Brian Nguyen: Actually start the presentation. I think it'd be good, that maybe we all introduce ourselves again.

10
00:03:51.930 --> 00:04:10.740
Brian Nguyen: Because I think a few people you hadn't seen maybe the last Friday that hadn't talked too much. Right. So I'd say that's probably a good idea to be true studios to Jerry one, last one, last time before you know because preferences, you're going to work on what project you like work on

11
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.140
Brian Nguyen: But, uh,

12
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:35.730
Brian Nguyen: Well, I guess I'll get started. You guys know me. I've been there. Yeah, you're at against your substitute teacher or wherever mentor has in the past week. Feel a little sad every asking you guys on to act. True, true mentors. Right. And so I hope you guys

13
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.250
Brian Nguyen: learned something new. Again, I'm Brian

14
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.720
Brian Nguyen: In the fourth year graduate students working on understanding, whatnot great directions are good.

15
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.710
Right.

16
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.260
Brian Nguyen: Again,

17
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.200
Victoria Choi: Incoming junior high school

18
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.070
Victoria Choi: as anything else I need to say

19
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.760
Brian Nguyen: It was tree.

20
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.510
Brian Nguyen: What we did last week.

21
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.420
Victoria Choi: I went to the field and I call

22
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.700
Aakrsh: My name is Dr. I am 50 years old. I'll be a junior next year at Dana hillsides.

23
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.360
Brian Nguyen: What to do where we can

24
00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:02.460
Aakrsh: Oh last weekend. It was a friend's birthday. So I did. We did like a drive by think

25
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.710
thanh: I am. My name is Tom and I'm from I'm introducing your at

26
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.210
thanh: Valley High School. And one thing I did last weekend was

27
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.440
thanh: I made a cake cake for my friends.

28
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.290
jeffrt7: Is the other ones like

29
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.770
jeffrt7: Ice cream in the middle of a bunch of lava cake so us

30
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.300
Theresa Carlos: My name is Teresa.

31
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:42.660
Theresa Carlos: I'm 16 years old and I'm going to be a senior in high school in New Jersey. And one thing I did over the weekend. I got bubble tea with my siblings and we went to the park.

32
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.850
Theresa Carlos: Yeah.

33
00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.260
jeffrt7: I'm Jeffrey for cigarettes, then

34
00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.450
jeffrt7: I don't. Yeah, my weekend was kind of boring.

35
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:10.200
jeffrt7: My sleep schedule is thrown off wax. I was like, out of it for most of the day by still mustered up the mental capacity to read a bunch of papers.

36
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.120
Yeah.

37
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.080
Eva Von Domaros: Okay, so I'm EVA. I'm a postdoc in our group.

38
00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.660
Eva Von Domaros: Yeah, my work weekend.

39
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:33.750
Eva Von Domaros: Hasn't been too exciting either. I was current evening. So I tried to stay away from people. Um,

40
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.390
Eva Von Domaros: Yeah, so that's it.

41
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.290
Eva Von Domaros: Hi.

42
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:55.440
Samuel Bekoe: My name is Samuel and I'm a second year of grad student. I'm a weekend or spent just cleaning my apartment and doing laundry and talking to friends and family back home. Yeah.

43
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.750
Brian Nguyen: This is a perfect time to do some cleaning

44
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:02.280
Brian Nguyen: Right.

45
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.060
Brian Nguyen: Okay, great. Thank you everyone for listening.

46
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:15.000
Brian Nguyen: So this guy today is that we will have some presentations read and mentors. So, Asia, Jeffrey, Sam.

47
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:26.280
Brian Nguyen: Patience to show up soon. Anytime moment right now. Yes I text him so I'll give a three to five minutes for segmentation and about our research.

48
00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:34.830
Brian Nguyen: What type of questions we're looking at. And then what what what type of roles you guys going to add in helping us out answering these questions.

49
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:47.070
Brian Nguyen: And then after this presentation will finish out what we were learning on Friday. So on the North Korean interactions. Are you guys ready to compete the binding energies are you own.

50
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:57.300
Brian Nguyen: Just let me know if you have problems, we can discover it one last time later define everything the whole whole deal. All right, now asking will show and

51
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:10.950
Brian Nguyen: Today will be the how to visualize some news molecular orbital interpret though all right into that ob, a very important point and skill you learn when you were working with your, your mentors. Alright.

52
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:27.450
Brian Nguyen: And the last thing I'll send, send out an email form a Google form to going to ask you what your preferences for some of the projects we have in your time availability. So that can can align your time time slots with their mentors. Right.

53
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:40.770
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so yeah. Are there any questions before we actually start with the presentation. Right. Okay. All right, so no questions.

54
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.830
Brian Nguyen: Well, okay, well,

55
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:51.840
Brian Nguyen: Anyway, like to, you know, centers like yeah, they're like to volunteer first

56
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:53.760
Brian Nguyen: Present.

57
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.410
Eva Von Domaros: I guess I can go first.

58
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.950
Eva Von Domaros: share my screen.

59
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.590
Eva Von Domaros: Wow, this is taking forever.

60
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.910
Brian Nguyen: Okay technology.

61
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.500
Eva Von Domaros: Yeah, might be due to the fact that I'm running a calculation in the background.

62
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:20.610
Brian Nguyen: Oh, yeah.

63
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.240
Brian Nguyen: All right.

64
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.500
Eva Von Domaros: Okay, here we go.

65
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:45.150
Eva Von Domaros: Okay, so the protest I envisioned for you would be quantum protons and acid base phenomena. I apologize for this presentation, being very, very basic, I guess you are way ahead of what I'm telling you know

66
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:57.510
Eva Von Domaros: Um, let's start with a brief introduction about assets and basis. I mean, you know, these substances from your daily life. So, you know, vinegar is acidic, you know that.

67
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:05.670
Eva Von Domaros: The sprinkles in your soda are just sold weighted carbon dioxide. And you also knows nitric acid.

68
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:13.050
Eva Von Domaros: Um, you also know that baking soda is basic, and then you need to add an s to make it work.

69
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:34.440
Eva Von Domaros: I want bladder slightly basic so this basic. Um, so you're familiar with these substances and you see the underlying chemical reactions here. So an acid molecule ha loses the H plus and the back reaction would be a base molecule be which accepts an H plus to form.

70
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.300
Eva Von Domaros: These

71
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:55.110
Eva Von Domaros: Class and await ions and the easier the molecule lose the proton or the more protons can be extracted by base molecules and the more acidic or the, the stronger the acid or the stronger the base.

72
00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:58.530
Eva Von Domaros: So that's essentially it

73
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:15.060
Eva Von Domaros: So if we now go to photo assets that means we go one step further photo means that you shine light on molecules and excite them. That means you transfer the molecule.

74
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:35.910
Eva Von Domaros: To any excited states. And then there are molecules which are more acidic when they're excited. So after shining light on them, they lose the proton easier and molecules can also be more basic and excited states and these substances are called photo acids and photo basis and

75
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:59.100
Eva Von Domaros: You might have noticed that everything that is photo in it is pretty fancy and has amazing applications, especially nowadays, where we want to have sustainable energy. So everything that is photo in it means it kind of absorbs energy from the sunlight, which we can then transform to other

76
00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:07.860
Eva Von Domaros: Kinds of energy. So these molecules have really amazing applications. And this is why we are so interested in them.

77
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:18.450
Eva Von Domaros: Okay Um okay now let's come to the theory. So this project is kind of all about these H plus particles.

78
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:29.670
Eva Von Domaros: You know, from Brian's introduction that we treat atoms and electrons in a different way on a different level. So atoms are what we call a classical particles.

79
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.720
Eva Von Domaros: They have positions XYZ, and they have a velocity or they don't have a velocity. And so that's fine too.

80
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:51.000
Eva Von Domaros: And they have mess and charge and the entire mess is assumed to be on that specific point in space electrons. On the other hand, are very, very small. So, we call them quantum particles and

81
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:59.760
Eva Von Domaros: they obey the uncertainty principle, which means we do not know the exact position empty except velocity at the same time.

82
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:18.060
Eva Von Domaros: So instead of using XYZ coordinates we described them by a wave function. So, which is the probability of finding them at a certain point, and these are the orbitals, you're calculating and your later today, visualizing with Brian

83
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:38.340
Eva Von Domaros: So the hydrogen atom actually is an atom. So usually we treat it as a classical particle, I guess you've done that with Brian, too. So I'm sure there are hydrogen atoms in your calculation. So you can look into your core Word file and then you will find the hydrogen atom with the XYZ coordinates.

84
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:46.410
Eva Von Domaros: But if you think about it, the hydrogen atom has the lowest math of all the atoms in the periodic table. So, um,

85
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:57.690
Eva Von Domaros: It's kind of in between atoms and electrons. And there are some experimental observations that indicate that the proton has a substantial quantum character.

86
00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:16.710
Eva Von Domaros: So what we do in this project is we take a photo as it so you can see the picture here. I call this gapes photo acids. So this is Theo female or semi know female. So the yellow Adam is a sulfur or selenium.

87
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.630
Eva Von Domaros: And

88
00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:30.960
Eva Von Domaros: Um, so you've you've met gave and gave us working on these further edits and gave us taking care of the photo part so gave is calculating the citations and all that.

89
00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:39.900
Eva Von Domaros: And your work would now be the following. So you would do a usual computation like characterizing characterization of these molecules.

90
00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:50.460
Eva Von Domaros: And after that you would treat quantum protons, which means that the hydrogen atom, which is attached to the yellow selenium or software, Adam.

91
00:15:51.060 --> 00:16:01.530
Eva Von Domaros: That will be a quantum particle and we will get away French. And for this, just as we get for the electrons. We might also consider quantum solvents, which means quantum water.

92
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:16.740
Eva Von Domaros: And after the computations, we'll also do analysis. So we'll calculate and compare the energies will also consider energy difference, just as you do with Brian right now for the interaction energy and we will see

93
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:36.930
Eva Von Domaros: If and how we can get acidity constants from a quantum proton, because this is not trivial. So this is something we'll have to think about and discuss this. And finally, will visualize and interpret the orbitals. So the electronic orbitals and the nuclear orbitals.

94
00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.000
Brian Nguyen: So what you can expect in this

95
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.840
Eva Von Domaros: PART IS YOU AROUND trouble more calculations, of course.

96
00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:57.180
Eva Von Domaros: However, the quantum protons are kind of a development version. So, for example, they, they don't go with defined so we'll have to bid to do a bit of file manipulation, maybe best scripting.

97
00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:02.850
Eva Von Domaros: I tend to use Python for my analysis. So if you like that, you know,

98
00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:11.100
Eva Von Domaros: You're happy or I'm happy to have you do that too. We'll use visualization, just as you'll do later today. And I think will also

99
00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:20.520
Eva Von Domaros: Closely collaborate with Gabe on this one. So we'll have meetings and discuss the background. And if you're interested. We'll also have meetings about the interesting applications of this

100
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:40.440
Eva Von Domaros: Yeah. And so the background knowledge as much as you like. So I just can echo what you've heard before. On Friday, just asked questions. Yeah, so that's basically the end of my presentation. And if you have any questions, I'm just go ahead and ask, I'll stop sharing now.

101
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:49.860
Brian Nguyen: Okay, thank you. Eva.

102
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:52.530
Brian Nguyen: Are there questions.

103
00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:57.810
Brian Nguyen: Like have questions.

104
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:11.490
Brian Nguyen: Okay. All right. So I do have maybe not questions for the project crazy, but maybe maybe on as

105
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:12.210
jeffrt7: You know,

106
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.530
Brian Nguyen: What is a postdoc

107
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:14.430
Brian Nguyen: Now maybe

108
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:42.390
Eva Von Domaros: Yes, so it is so um it's part of the academic career, I would say, so what happens usually as you go to call it they you then you go to grad school, you get your PhD and postdoc is kind of what do you do between you get your PhD and you get a faculty position if you get one. So,

109
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:57.270
Eva Von Domaros: Yeah, you basically you just do science and teaching so you don't have to obtain a degree anymore. When I first saw my first poster year SOMEONE ASKED ME HOW WAS BEING A post. And I was like,

110
00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.200
Theresa Carlos: It's the best.

111
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:12.060
Eva Von Domaros: So if you have a job, of course, it's only temporary. But you have a job you do research. You do what you like to do and you don't have that pressure of having to finish a PhD, so it's awesome.

112
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:21.180
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, let's get to this is for everyone to know. So I'm not sure if you guys ever heard a postdoc before

113
00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:28.920
Brian Nguyen: Great night but yeah okay good and joy. You guys have been heard.

114
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:40.590
Brian Nguyen: I haven't heard about postdoc me to join under I started in my graduate school or thinking about it. Okay. All right. Thank you. Eva appreciate that.

115
00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:44.190
Brian Nguyen: Other mentors. Want to get started presenting

116
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:56.790
jeffrt7: My presentation is very much not pretty. Like it was because I currently don't actually have

117
00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:01.980
jeffrt7: An ongoing applications project by will be taking up one or two.

118
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:06.930
jeffrt7: Within the next week or two. So it's like perfect timing for this.

119
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:19.230
jeffrt7: So I think I'll so there's a chance that I'll be working on something in future related to, I didn't undergrad, so I'll

120
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:20.880
Do the

121
00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.860
Let's take this presentation so

122
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.110
jeffrt7: Oh, it's only two slides and it's three pictures so

123
00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:47.010
jeffrt7: So I like to just start off with what it didn't my undergraduate research. So it has to do with competitions on surface chemistry and specifically metal surfaces.

124
00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:59.220
jeffrt7: So the metal surfaces like the one made up of these gold Adams here, they're able to catalyze reactions, which means making your for certain reactions to happen.

125
00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:11.790
jeffrt7: And this has applications in I think primarily in organic chemistry. So, the most notable example is probably the hydrogen nation reaction using platinum.

126
00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:24.210
jeffrt7: You can also have occasions in things like fuel generation carbon dioxide captured and you can even look at Astro chemistry. So chemistry that happens in space.

127
00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:34.620
jeffrt7: So for this chemistry to actually happen certain reactions in your reaction have to actually stick onto the surface and in many of these cases.

128
00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:42.660
jeffrt7: They'll have them break into fragments in the process. So my specific project, which is not this image here, but it's pretty similar.

129
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:54.690
jeffrt7: Was investigating the way that methanol will break apart and stick onto a platinum surface and it happens that there are multiple different ways that it could end up breaking apart.

130
00:21:55.410 --> 00:22:03.930
jeffrt7: And knowing how to act, how it actually breaks apart is a primate interest because you would be able to control the reactions that you're doing.

131
00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:19.140
jeffrt7: By doing things like this where the surface isn't exactly flat, you have certain kinks and those kings cannot end up changing the way that the chemistry happens and this project I did had primarily

132
00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:26.580
jeffrt7: An application in direct methanol fuel cells. So its fuel cells that produce electricity from methanol.

133
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:34.650
jeffrt7: So here's the complicated thing. The theory project I'm currently working on, it's related to density functional theory.

134
00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:46.170
jeffrt7: I don't think anyone would expect anyone to understand what that the functional theory is within a short talk like this. So within the methods that people use to do calculations.

135
00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:49.530
jeffrt7: Tennessee functional theory is

136
00:22:50.760 --> 00:23:01.650
jeffrt7: one of, if not the most popular that are used in the world. And so to explain what density functional theory is here's two very different images of what

137
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:14.370
jeffrt7: An item looks like. So the one on the left is the wrong way of viewing an item where electrons don't actually go around in these like defined orbits around the nucleus.

138
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:25.320
jeffrt7: Instead, it's something more like the one on the right, where you have these electron clouds that form around the nucleus civil electrons are just buzzing around inside these clouds.

139
00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.960
Eva Von Domaros: Is it just me, I'm still seeing slide one

140
00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:31.170
Eva Von Domaros: I think you're talking about the second one.

141
00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:32.820
Yeah.

142
00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:35.850
jeffrt7: Is that a problem for anyone else.

143
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:39.240
Theresa Carlos: Oh,

144
00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.550
jeffrt7: The presentation can

145
00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:58.410
jeffrt7: You see it now. Okay, I'll just presentation mode. Okay. Sorry. So yeah, the lot in the left wrong view orbits doesn't actually work. The one on the right with the clouds, where the electrons are buzzing around inside these clouds. That's the more correct view.

146
00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:10.500
jeffrt7: So just like regular clouds have certain density of luck of water droplets these electron clouds have a certain density of electrons within them.

147
00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:24.840
jeffrt7: And you'll also notice that. So what's cool about density functional theory is that you can extract a ton of information about atoms and molecules just from looking at how these clouds are shaped

148
00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:44.370
jeffrt7: So you'll also notice that these clouds are in specific formations so very rudimentary view. But just like gravity, there are certain forces that keep electrons to form these certain formations and

149
00:24:45.420 --> 00:25:04.050
jeffrt7: If you can figure out what the force is look like you can define how these densities are formed. So how these Clouds are formed, and even at the same time. If you know how the Clouds are formed, you can extract what kinds of forces, keep those clouds in the shape that they are

150
00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:22.920
jeffrt7: So this is easier said than done. There are certain effects that quantum effects that we can only approximate not defined specifically. So as theorists, we need to approximate these forces and there are certain mathematically prove

151
00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.610
Brian Nguyen: Theorems

152
00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:38.580
jeffrt7: So that means that they have to hold true behind these theories that we need to follow and the problem right now is that current density functional theories that people use they violate one of these very, very important theorems that should that they should follow

153
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.740
jeffrt7: So our current project is aiming to invent a new theory.

154
00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:56.310
jeffrt7: Well, a related theory that actually satisfies all these theorems. So what this means for an applications project is that there are certain applications where

155
00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:01.530
jeffrt7: These issues that we run into using the traditional methods.

156
00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:12.570
jeffrt7: Might be solved by this new theory. So one of our recently graduated group members had a project where this was true, where

157
00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:24.360
jeffrt7: There are certain calculations that they were trying to do that might be remedied in terms of accuracy like being more accurate or being able to actually be done by using this new theory.

158
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:33.450
jeffrt7: And because of the shutdown. I didn't actually get to learn about it from the person himself.

159
00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:44.610
jeffrt7: But I'll be talking to fill up about that specific project. And I'm also currently picking up a calculation relate to

160
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:47.820
jeffrt7: What Sam might bring up which is

161
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:55.530
jeffrt7: His previous work on like the nights and nights think that should sound like still current

162
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:02.910
jeffrt7: Well, yeah, but yeah, I'm proud currently in the process of learning ballot.

163
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:11.310
jeffrt7: So that's another applications project that you might pick up on. So like if his projects.

164
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.670
jeffrt7: You'd be doing terrible calculations.

165
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:16.770
jeffrt7: I can

166
00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:20.670
jeffrt7: Also be teaching scripting to make your life easier.

167
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:34.950
jeffrt7: And anything that you're interested in, in terms of chemistry. The things related to these projects or even outside, you can just let me know. I'll study up on it and then

168
00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:39.000
jeffrt7: I'm also willing to teach that as well.

169
00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.880
jeffrt7: So stop sharing

170
00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:56.130
Brian Nguyen: Thank you. Jeffrey. I have a question like every oh

171
00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.200
Brian Nguyen: You're back

172
00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:04.230
jeffrt7: To turn on my fan. Yeah.

173
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:04.740
Yeah.

174
00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:06.240
Brian Nguyen: Yeah.

175
00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:15.600
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

176
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:22.770
Brian Nguyen: Sam, can you present. I'm gonna try. I'm trying to reach out to Jason we look around.

177
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.340
jeffrt7: Okay, I'll call just

178
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:33.480
Samuel Bekoe: Trying to bring up my slide.

179
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.320
Samuel Bekoe: guys see my screen.

180
00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:14.520
Samuel Bekoe: Okay, okay. Yeah.

181
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:19.500
Samuel Bekoe: So my name is Sam again and

182
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.980
Samuel Bekoe: Over the past few years.

183
00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:29.160
Samuel Bekoe: Just two years of being with the first group I've run a bunch of calculations on

184
00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:46.320
Samuel Bekoe: lanta nice and aconites complexes. So, for the purpose of this presentation ages chose this title prediction of excitation spectra of London tonight complexes. So basically what

185
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:48.930
Samuel Bekoe: This is all about is

186
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.630
Samuel Bekoe: In chemistry,

187
00:29:52.860 --> 00:30:06.270
Samuel Bekoe: We try to come up with. We try to run reactions and in running this kind of reactions. Some of them just can take forever to run. And so you want to

188
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:29.340
Samuel Bekoe: Speed up this processes and in speeding up this processes you imply something you guys are familiar with a catalyst and these catalysts. Also, I also chemical compounds and they are mostly made up made up of metallics with some

189
00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:35.670
Samuel Bekoe: Other items around which we call the guns and so

190
00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:47.370
Samuel Bekoe: we synthesize this catalyst in the in the lab. But then after synthesizing this catalyst, you want to

191
00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.050
Samuel Bekoe: Characterize and

192
00:30:49.380 --> 00:31:11.610
Samuel Bekoe: See if what you synthesize is what you have seen. Okay. And that brings me to this topic. So one of the earlier calculations. I did in the past was the synthesis of this Trish trial mythos seelye circumvent the diner for room complex. So basically,

193
00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:20.550
Samuel Bekoe: This was an experimental work done in the lab. So they started off with this compound, if you guys can see my mouse right

194
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:26.610
Samuel Bekoe: Right. Great. I can't, I can't see you on the screen so

195
00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:29.520
Yeah.

196
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:32.190
Samuel Bekoe: Yes, so

197
00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:44.910
Samuel Bekoe: In the lab day they start off with this term complex and essentially or basically they don't want to synthesize this compound here but

198
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.440
Samuel Bekoe: When they do the synthesis

199
00:31:50.490 --> 00:32:07.890
Samuel Bekoe: A compound degrades very quickly it. It's very stable so they can characterize what a day, a fine by characterized. I mean, they run a bunch of other analysis, which includes spectroscopy to find

200
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:25.890
Samuel Bekoe: To to actually know or K I'm forming this tutorial complex with these lead guns around it. So they characterize it. But the templates or songs they would. Are they couldn't characterize it. And the only thing they could do was to just

201
00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:39.840
Samuel Bekoe: Calculate actually Rhonda UV this spectrum as the ultraviolet, visible spectra on this complex. Okay. And that was the only thing they had so

202
00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:44.760
Samuel Bekoe: They don't know anything about the complex different okay and

203
00:32:47.910 --> 00:33:00.540
Samuel Bekoe: They have to take another step to know exactly what they've calculated. So what Dave synthesize and that is where our competition comes in. So we start off with

204
00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:11.580
Samuel Bekoe: Complexes they have run it, but a bunch of calculations on them and we do some checks and preliminary checks and then we we look at

205
00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:16.110
Samuel Bekoe: The spectra. So, as she can see right here.

206
00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:21.840
Samuel Bekoe: In the, in the red line that is the that is the

207
00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:28.140
Samuel Bekoe: The experimentally calculated you this spectrum gone and

208
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:31.860
Samuel Bekoe: The blue line, you've seen is the

209
00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:47.160
Samuel Bekoe: Is the computer spectra I calculated. So basically, what I did was to first start off by calculating or optimizing this structure here, which is the studying complex

210
00:33:47.640 --> 00:34:05.400
Samuel Bekoe: And then I also optimize the structure here, but also there was the possibility of not just forming this complex here that could also be the possibility of still maintaining this complex, but just kick off, sir, but just

211
00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:17.520
Samuel Bekoe: Ejection an electron. So there was a possibility of still forming this complex here so I run a bunch of calculations on them, which takes me to the next slide.

212
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:27.330
Samuel Bekoe: So this is the complex, they want to form. This was a studying complex, they look pretty. The same. So basically what you're doing, was to just kick off this

213
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:33.990
Samuel Bekoe: Item here, which is, which was a bromine just kick off this item and then formed this complex here.

214
00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:47.040
Samuel Bekoe: But, like I was saying. There was also the possibility of, you know, just kicking off this bromine retaining the bromine and just kicking off an electron to form this complex here. And when you do that.

215
00:34:49.140 --> 00:35:02.160
Samuel Bekoe: The spectrum spectra could also be the same or different. And so what I did was to optimize all of this structures down here and then calculate the spectra and then I basically just

216
00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:19.200
Samuel Bekoe: compared the spectral with what they had experimentally. So over here, as you can see the blue line again corresponds to this complex here and the red line corresponds to you, forming

217
00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:30.390
Samuel Bekoe: still retaining the bromine but kicking off an electron and green line running down there, which is the studying complex, it's, it's hard to see.

218
00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:43.680
Samuel Bekoe: But there's a Greenland running down there, which is the studying complex okay now comparing all this spectra to the experimental spectra back here it is. I began to see that.

219
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:59.670
Samuel Bekoe: It is actually this complex that they were able to cut the rice, which was what they form and which was what they expected. So, in, in, in essence, we are using our computation or two to

220
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:12.330
Samuel Bekoe: Kind of validate what they are finding India experiment and another copulation around which was very recent, and Alice word Jeffrey was

221
00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:19.440
Samuel Bekoe: Pointing out to was a synthesis of article in places where

222
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.440
Samuel Bekoe: You're trying to form this

223
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:39.180
Samuel Bekoe: Land tonight system, which in this case was a boat set some areas and your demon and with all this league and surrounded and like I said on purpose of farming or this complex is

224
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:53.820
Samuel Bekoe: Because of their one not not entirely because of but one of the reasons why they form these complexes is because of the catalytic nature because they can speed up other

225
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.910
Samuel Bekoe: Other reaction reactions. So

226
00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:12.270
Samuel Bekoe: They formed this complex but again it's unstable and they can't characterize it. And so we employ a computational tools again to to run this reactions and then

227
00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:30.090
Samuel Bekoe: Compare our data to DS and up here was the case for some areas where you had L ln being some Iran. And this was the case for your demon, which were which was what they were interested in and we do other stuff.

228
00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:34.230
Samuel Bekoe: I say just calculating the spectra. We also

229
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:44.340
Samuel Bekoe: Look at the electronic configurations of this complexes which are very important because based on the electronic configuration.

230
00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:49.530
Samuel Bekoe: You can that complex can either be

231
00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:51.030
Samuel Bekoe: Like

232
00:37:52.260 --> 00:38:16.080
Samuel Bekoe: A very good reducing oxidative agents and so we also do all those authorizations and now today. The other projects have been doing so I'm running at our calculations on the side, which I don't have. I have not put together all the results yet. So if we were to come on board.

233
00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:17.670
Samuel Bekoe: We could

234
00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:32.640
Samuel Bekoe: Do is exciting react calculations and also my other projects I'm working on right now is so computing this spectra, you're seeing here.

235
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:48.900
Samuel Bekoe: takes a lot of effort and we are trying to come up with a new library and you were to calculate not really a new way. But we are trying to add on to the way we calculate the spectra and that is

236
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:54.270
Samuel Bekoe: On the other side of what I'm doing so.

237
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:57.720
Samuel Bekoe: When I said I just say thank you.

238
00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:10.290
Brian Nguyen: Hey, are they question.

239
00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:18.720
jeffrt7: I'm actually have a question on something I've been thinking about. So for these complexes. If they're so short lived.

240
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:31.080
jeffrt7: How are they actually being able to be used as a catalyst if is it like they find out. Okay, this complex is really useful. So we'll find ways of making it more stable. Is that what they would do.

241
00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:32.820
Samuel Bekoe: Yes, basically. Yeah.

242
00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:45.060
Eva Von Domaros: I guess you can also generate them and see to so you generate them. And so just the second day of their you actually directly use them. So maybe

243
00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:48.120
Samuel Bekoe: They do something. Yeah. So yeah.

244
00:39:48.600 --> 00:40:00.240
Eva Von Domaros: I also just want to add a brief comment on this. So, um, I don't know how familiar you are with the spectra. So you eat this spectra. So what happens is you shine light on the molecule.

245
00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:11.850
Eva Von Domaros: And so it's actually related to the photo properties. I was talking about earlier. And what happens is, since the electrons can only occupy distinct orbital and cannot take any energy value.

246
00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:23.910
Eva Von Domaros: They absorb energy of that certain amount of so they absorb light of that certain energy sorry for being so confusing.

247
00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:37.440
Eva Von Domaros: And so they get excited and they also admit the same amount of energy or another amount of energy, but it's always limited by the energies of the orbitals, they can occupy

248
00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:48.780
Eva Von Domaros: And so the experimentalists can measure the spectra, but they cannot actually look at the electrons, but we can so we can calculate the orbital energies.

249
00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:58.650
Eva Von Domaros: The methods. Sam is using our every state of the art so I'm the excited states calculations are pretty advanced

250
00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:07.080
Eva Von Domaros: And also related to these photo properties. I just wanted to add that. And also you might have noticed that there was visible and you'd be this.

251
00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:21.570
Eva Von Domaros: And that means that that the light that is absorbed or emitted is part of the visible spectrum. So this is what actually makes compounds colorful. Yeah, I just wanted to, to add this sorry

252
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:23.670
Brian Nguyen: Oh yeah, good.

253
00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:25.590
Samuel Bekoe: Stuff is great. Yeah, thanks.

254
00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:28.530
Brian Nguyen: Are there other questions.

255
00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:31.890
Brian Nguyen: Thank good

256
00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:34.080
Brian Nguyen: Like in cases.

257
00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:44.040
Brian Nguyen: Like a join us. So we do a little introduction. Can you introduce this so knowing, like what you did over the weekend and maybe

258
00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.310
Brian Nguyen: You can give your presentation to

259
00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.980
yujm1: Like a general introduction

260
00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:59.940
yujm1: Yeah, okay. Yeah. So my name is Jason Yeah, sorry. I came in a little late. I'm a third year grad student with Philip M and what I did this weekend.

261
00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:00.900
Yeah.

262
00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:03.060
yujm1: You know I

263
00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:07.650
yujm1: went outside, try to get some exercise and enjoy the day

264
00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:15.240
yujm1: And also you know that a little bit of work, but didn't think too much about that. And I guess just relaxed.

265
00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:18.780
Cool.

266
00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:24.510
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, they can you have a presentation presentation.

267
00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.430
yujm1: Yeah, yeah, it's my turn.

268
00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:32.010
yujm1: Yes. Okay. And I have the ability to share my screen.

269
00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:33.840
Brian Nguyen: Yes, I think so. Okay.

270
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:38.640
yujm1: Do you guys see

271
00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:44.430
yujm1: This image is it too small to big circular to present this thing.

272
00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:57.900
yujm1: Does that, does that work yeah okay might be a little blurry. I don't know why that is. Okay, so I sent Brian a title of the talk.

273
00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:05.700
yujm1: That I was going to give. And then I changed my mind. Just because I think this is more related to the research that I'm currently doing.

274
00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:15.300
yujm1: Although if we were to do work on work together, then we might be considering doing other projects to and all sort of mentioned at the end.

275
00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:34.380
yujm1: So what this picture basically is is very similar to what Sam just talked about, but perhaps with a bit of a different motivation. So, here, let me just explain the components of this slide. So in the beginning. Oh, sorry about that there's some overlap is there a blocking my

276
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:36.450
My picture.

277
00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:42.360
yujm1: On my end. Okay. When dragging us decide. All right. So in the beginning.

278
00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:55.830
yujm1: People have found transition metal catalyst. So you've heard the term catalyst from last talk to be incredibly useful for lots of applications in both biological

279
00:43:56.610 --> 00:44:10.920
yujm1: Fields, as well as chemical fields. So there's applications in the manufacturing setting as well as medicinal purposes. And so that's sort of represented by this very prototypical transition metal compound known as Pharaoh scene.

280
00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:20.940
yujm1: And so one thing that our group focuses on is that we try to find very similarly applicable and useful.

281
00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:31.830
yujm1: Compounds of the Act denied elements as well. So you have the transition metals which are in the 3D block and the bulk of the periodic table and you had the lat the Knights of aconites which lie.

282
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:37.620
yujm1: At the bottom of the periodic table and F block, but for the longest time, it was found that because

283
00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:49.350
yujm1: Of the f orbitals associated with these lands nights and nights that they were less chemically useful and perhaps why that was is because the f orbitals possess very limited.

284
00:44:50.310 --> 00:45:06.240
yujm1: You know radio extent or the f orbitals are smaller than the d orbitals. And we're less less likely to form these cavaillon bonds that we find so useful for doing all sorts of chemical processes that we need, you know, in our daily life and things that would make it much better.

285
00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:19.620
yujm1: And so this sort of middle slide represents sort of some of the computational and theoretical tools that we use to sort of try to bridge this gap. And so this is represented by our trusty

286
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:29.220
yujm1: time independent Schrodinger equation which is one of the most fundamental equations at least us in quantum mechanics. And you may or may not be familiar with it, um,

287
00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:37.590
yujm1: And then here's just a picture of supercomputing clusters. So these two aspects, both the theory and the computation are what we use.

288
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:47.310
yujm1: And so through this and the sort of motivation, it actually gave way to us, discovering some new Act denied chemistry that

289
00:45:48.150 --> 00:46:03.240
yujm1: You know that represents some first steps towards bridging this gap between some of the more established and useful transition metal catalysts and some of the F block elements and that comes in the form of this Act tonight compound that actually

290
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:13.740
yujm1: Has a very similar structure to this prototypical transition metal compound. As you can see here from these five members rings. It's got a few more other things.

291
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:24.660
yujm1: On the lignans but that's just because of I suppose what that's sort of what we need in order to obtain this linear structure. And you can see here that this orbital.

292
00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:30.060
yujm1: That is its highest occupied molecular orbital. It's actually very similar

293
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:43.170
yujm1: In shape to that observed for the transition metal compound above. And so we've discovered some sort of analog very similar to that which we find very useful. I'm in lots of industrial and

294
00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:50.910
yujm1: medicinal purposes for the aconites and so that's sort of one of our demonstration of

295
00:46:51.360 --> 00:47:01.320
yujm1: Perhaps some of the things that we can do together in this group. I'm not saying that we're going to discover a new compound, but we have the tools and we have the motivation to

296
00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:10.230
yujm1: Ask the right questions that might lead to discovering new compounds that are currently being evaluated for potential applicability to

297
00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:14.310
yujm1: All these fields and applications that we would like

298
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:25.110
yujm1: So that's one thing. And this is sort of just one slide representing sort of this process. The other, the other thing I don't have a slide for but it's more of a

299
00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:30.420
yujm1: It's more of a, I would say a computational project.

300
00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:40.890
yujm1: Where we sort of come up with ways to search through the vast space of potential chemicals that we, that might be realized.

301
00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:54.330
yujm1: And to come up with some that are the best in some way or another. And so how we do that is we have computational software that tells us many interesting properties of molecules and chemical systems.

302
00:47:55.170 --> 00:48:08.430
yujm1: And perhaps we can come up with some computational or algorithmic way to sort of search through these chemicals and come up with those that are the best in, let's say, the energy or the

303
00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:23.220
yujm1: orbital energies or, you know, these sort of geometric properties. And so that's a very broad project. And so part of that one would involve us sitting down together and coming up with a proposal about what exactly we want

304
00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:42.330
yujm1: To accomplish regarding this, but I have a general idea ready. And so just to give an example of one potential application that we've explored in the past, is that we've tried to optimize the fluorescence of small molecules through changing up. It's not looking through possible structures.

305
00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:45.330
yujm1: In a systematic way, and

306
00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:52.620
yujm1: The reason for this is just because we've tried to come up with those which had the best Chem a lumen essence.

307
00:48:52.950 --> 00:49:06.570
yujm1: And the point of that is, you know, we could potentially use them as biomarkers for things such as cancer detection or, you know, disease detection, prevention and so that's sort of one example of a potential

308
00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:17.610
yujm1: Reason why this might be cool and why it might be applicable. So that's the other potential thing that we could work on together both of those are interesting and I think, you know,

309
00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:28.110
yujm1: We can make it into an enriching internship experience, either way. So with that being said stop sharing my screen.

310
00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:31.170
yujm1: I think that's it. Thanks.

311
00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:37.590
Brian Nguyen: Alright, thank you. Good question for Jason

312
00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:42.660
Brian Nguyen: Good. All right.

313
00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:46.230
Brian Nguyen: Thank you my presentation to

314
00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:50.130
Brian Nguyen: share my screen.

315
00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:57.810
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

316
00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:02.310
Brian Nguyen: Alright, everyone is Brian

317
00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:26.340
Brian Nguyen: Dan will be presenting a question to you, everyone. What are non crazy directions. Do you mind that non Kobe interactions is synonymous to internal internal feature molecular forces. So you can ask this question to the ICC piano. Can you can remind me what type of internal forces. Oh, yeah.

318
00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:32.430
Brian Nguyen: Shout out.

319
00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:45.360
Victoria Choi: dipole dipole

320
00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:47.310
Brian Nguyen: dipole dipole

321
00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:49.080
Victoria Choi: Fun discretion.

322
00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:51.690
Brian Nguyen: On this version.

323
00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:53.700
Victoria Choi: Bonnie

324
00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:56.250
Brian Nguyen: Bonnie thanks Victoria.

325
00:50:57.570 --> 00:51:05.400
Brian Nguyen: Keep those interactions in mind, and I'm going to read present you kind of examples of non creative actions.

326
00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:20.970
Brian Nguyen: Some questions that I'm trying to investigate potential collaboration that have been working out from this logic and then kind of talk about you know what what type of roles, you may have on the project I'm working on now. We're going to be addressing these questions.

327
00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:29.820
Brian Nguyen: So, how important are not really into action. Well, one of the things that you can kind of Seiko is the sample on the left is to get to

328
00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:38.280
Brian Nguyen: You know one question that we always have is you know how to act. How does it get to climb walls and how can a time was upside down.

329
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:48.030
Brian Nguyen: Because they're forming non coven interactions with your feet right there's interaction or we can upset, break it and reform it each time.

330
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:58.350
Brian Nguyen: And let's say one very unique thing that you can see in nature, but the darkroom works on very very small things there. And I'm very malecki scale.

331
00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:05.640
Brian Nguyen: One thing that comes into mind and that will again be related. And I will discuss later on these protein. Protein directions.

332
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:19.200
Brian Nguyen: proteins interact these chapters, they form, it's very important non creative direction. So you see here, ionic bonds. Hydrogen bonding hydrophobic in general interactions with the same as dispersion directions.

333
00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:36.060
Brian Nguyen: How, how did they all work together to interact and you know let's play a role in the cell signaling processes or how they see you. Nice to meet interesting design different drugs that bind well to the protein or to target.

334
00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:44.760
Brian Nguyen: And so where do we get, you know, how, how can we visualize these interactions.

335
00:52:45.840 --> 00:53:03.690
Brian Nguyen: One of the things I know the previous presentation. There's a lot of discussion about molecular orbital in this picture, we have descriptions of some of these net tonight complexes. So, metal complexes and this is a picture of the highest molecular orbital lowest unoccupied.

336
00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:13.890
Brian Nguyen: On a professional like the orbital these users actually describing the interaction of the electrons describing the bonding between all these atoms.

337
00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:32.220
Brian Nguyen: Ions and from these on the cake on electronic structured, we can kind of me understand the chemical process. So then the question is, that is equivalent to, you know, visualize these like or rules for non Koreans reactions and can we kind of visualize it and interpret

338
00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:40.950
Brian Nguyen: So there'll be a lot of, you know, a little bit of theoretical development. There's Daniel Where are these tiny energies coming from now I see you

339
00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:51.210
Brian Nguyen: Friday we started learning how to compete. These tiny energy. Right. It's not enough for us, as you know, for our group to just run a calculation, get a number

340
00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:58.230
Brian Nguyen: And not really understanding where are these numbers coming from right and so that's why we can try to do all right with me.

341
00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:18.300
Brian Nguyen: From this project within have a potential collaboration with the vendor wall group, a very experimental is actually synthesizing some of these compounds. Right. And so one of the compounds, they're interested in is designed is like softly need compound and adding different

342
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:30.540
Brian Nguyen: Mistakes a different functional groups to this is the compounds that can be used to present perfect tense with drug for targeting reivers own

343
00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:38.970
Brian Nguyen: And so I developed a model in which we can kind of study these interactions and we found that there is a very important

344
00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:49.410
Brian Nguyen: New interaction. Maybe it's very different. You haven't heard yet, but this is like called chlorine to two pi system interaction. So

345
00:54:49.920 --> 00:55:00.720
Brian Nguyen: This is like the art to the RNA and isn't a nucleotide and answering the question is, how, how can you compete and how do we care dress different directions.

346
00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:19.590
Brian Nguyen: Can you generate a trend and we really understand the specificity of this interaction, like the orientation and how scoring interact with these these dreams. Okay. And so that's the collaboration and working with the venerable roofing Oh, more than happy to have you tagged along the incident.

347
00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:37.050
Brian Nguyen: Was your role right how do we start tackling these complex chemistry questions. And so one of the best way to tackle anything that's complex us to begin by breaking it down to smaller, less complicated

348
00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:50.640
Brian Nguyen: Item right to make it smaller and in tackling those things, one by one, though, are we going to be working on is we need to kind of start on determining helped me out determine what available competition methods.

349
00:55:51.390 --> 00:56:00.960
Brian Nguyen: I can repeat these can actually predict a novel chlorine by interaction, I have an idea. But I need your help to verify that idea for me.

350
00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:09.870
Brian Nguyen: And then from the last slide, possibly designing a new I saw some new drugs in silicosis so it means that you just do on a computer.

351
00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:15.330
Brian Nguyen: And then determine trends with these binding and sees an entire understanding what they what they really mean.

352
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:31.710
Brian Nguyen: And then you can have some contributions. If you guys to do a little bit more dig into a little bit more. The mathematics and physics like and how to help me out. And maybe try to contribute to decision a nation of these non creative actions. So those are possible.

353
00:56:33.330 --> 00:56:48.270
Brian Nguyen: Area, so you can work on we'll jump back and forth. And now that's a pretty good experience, right. So I just want to thank you everyone for your attention, and I'll show you guys this little picture is how will be socializing in 2020

354
00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:55.410
Brian Nguyen: We're doing a pretty good job and hopefully make something good out of this whole experience right

355
00:56:57.210 --> 00:56:57.600
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

356
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.790
Brian Nguyen: Thank you guys.

357
00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:03.360
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

358
00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:06.810
Brian Nguyen: guys have questions for me.

359
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:17.610
Eva Von Domaros: Okay, so now that you've heard everything. Do you have any questions, and also to Brian or

360
00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.070
Eva Von Domaros: To anyone else.

361
00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:47.850
Brian Nguyen: All right. Yeah, I know we we talked a lot information that you will have this recording and stuff for you guys to look at it later today. All right. Let's take a look at it again. All right. I want to run. Applause Thank you to all the mentors for presenting today. I know it's great.

362
00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:53.040
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so

363
00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:55.680
Brian Nguyen: I think that, you know, so

364
00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:57.420
Brian Nguyen: So,

365
00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:02.370
Brian Nguyen: Right, thank you. Eva Sam Jason Jeffrey for Jenny.

366
00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:08.970
Brian Nguyen: Now I'm going to be working with ISIS to finish up some of the things that we started on Friday.

367
00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:11.460
Brian Nguyen: So,

368
00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:15.330
Brian Nguyen: You guys free free one stick around and not

369
00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:17.910
Eva Von Domaros: Okay. Thanks everyone.

370
00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:19.560
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

371
00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.020
Brian Nguyen: All right.

372
00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:26.910
Brian Nguyen: Thank you.

373
00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:38.790
Brian Nguyen: Oh my god. Laughs Oh, Jeffrey you fuzzy you stick around. Okay. All right. Yes. How do you feel as a bunch of projects with taught that you

374
00:58:43.530 --> 00:58:43.950
Brian Nguyen: Do every

375
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:45.240
Brian Nguyen: Day.

376
00:58:46.770 --> 00:58:52.320
Brian Nguyen: Yes. All right. This is all the chemistry up there and they're trying to look at. Right, so

377
00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:58.350
Brian Nguyen: Okay, guess their next order of business is all right.

378
00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:02.370
Brian Nguyen: Would you would you have for me today. Let's hear

379
00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:11.040
Brian Nguyen: Your assignee energy constellations, you get that problems. I haven't gotten emails from you guys and I am assuming you guys

380
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:13.230
Brian Nguyen: Didn't. All right.

381
00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:19.080
Brian Nguyen: Good sentence to be not some job.

382
00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:20.970
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

383
00:59:22.530 --> 00:59:36.840
Brian Nguyen: Jason good guys are getting the hang of it. All right, so if if we are you guys you guys all got the hang of it, the orca um I've ever got the hang of it. And now we'll just going to show the results that we have right

384
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:44.190
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so we'll review. I think it's important to kind of talk about Britain enough

385
00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:58.620
Brian Nguyen: Remember how we compute by the energies are once you compete by the energy

386
01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:20.640
Theresa Carlos: He said,

387
01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:26.010
Theresa Carlos: He said p minus T something

388
01:00:28.050 --> 01:00:30.810
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, that's correct. What

389
01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:34.080
Brian Nguyen: Well, what did all the variable me what he got a

390
01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:36.360
Theresa Carlos: Energy

391
01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:41.220
Theresa Carlos: And then he sent me his energy

392
01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:44.010
Theresa Carlos: He

393
01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:48.510
Brian Nguyen: Accomplished

394
01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:01.380
Brian Nguyen: Writing providing energy and it is a. We call it the super more likely

395
01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:03.480
Brian Nguyen: Approach.

396
01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:05.460
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

397
01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:08.280
Brian Nguyen: Remind you guys what they are.

398
01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:15.330
Brian Nguyen: Thank you. So this is the delta triangle. He

399
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:25.830
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so you can kind of remember go over here, the protein is psycho lock the key and lock right

400
01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:32.220
Brian Nguyen: Okay, and then you have another call this a

401
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:34.560
Brian Nguyen: And then we'll call this

402
01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:42.450
Brian Nguyen: Okay. All right, and so

403
01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.500
Brian Nguyen: It's at the total energy of your

404
01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:58.590
Brian Nguyen: Your mom or a or you're pregnant. A plus the total energy your second be excited self minus the

405
01:01:59.670 --> 01:02:14.130
Brian Nguyen: Total energy of this complete conflict. Okay. And you might miss it, you have this what you know these interactions in between that stuff over. And so that's kind of what is the leftover piece that we're trying to that is completed. Okay.

406
01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:17.190
Brian Nguyen: All right.

407
01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:20.310
Brian Nguyen: Sharing

408
01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.190
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so there's going to be tricky.

409
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:34.050
Brian Nguyen: Arrow fund log into VPN right we might lose connection by the you lose connection to just come back leave and come back to do good.

410
01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:42.690
Brian Nguyen: And I'm logging into

411
01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:44.430
Brian Nguyen: Right now.

412
01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:55.080
Brian Nguyen: Because fine art kit.

413
01:02:56.850 --> 01:02:58.470
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so

414
01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:01.020
Brian Nguyen: Go to

415
01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:08.940
Brian Nguyen: I'm assuming everyone was able to compete. These right every single molecule then during

416
01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:10.830
Brian Nguyen: The

417
01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:28.710
Brian Nguyen: All these other complexes. I have our show. I'm gonna try to show you kind of like how I organize my my data so that you guys can use it as a reference English teachers to kind of organize your own calculation.

418
01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:43.200
Brian Nguyen: Does it, you know, to the mind that you will always be running a bunch of calculation and sometimes may not work on that project for some for a while, but you will return come back to it. It's always good to keep a very organized notebook. Okay.

419
01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:49.500
Brian Nguyen: All right, so I'm just going to log into my computer.

420
01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:55.860
Brian Nguyen: Right, and then

421
01:03:57.270 --> 01:04:00.990
Brian Nguyen: Just go to your computer, you have the calculation.

422
01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:03.930
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

423
01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:09.900
Brian Nguyen: All right, I'm going a little fast that

424
01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:14.760
Brian Nguyen: Feel free to stop me. Alright, so here's my calculation.

425
01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:28.770
Brian Nguyen: Non Covina interactions, use my table. Here's all my folders. I wrote a script to kind of organize all days at Ronaldo script to kind of like run defined for me. All right.

426
01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:36.090
Brian Nguyen: But if you do Ellis star show you each when I ran here.

427
01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:40.530
Brian Nguyen: At all the structure I optimize. All right.

428
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:58.230
Brian Nguyen: For you guys. You guys are running RDF key okay for these. So these are single point energy calculations. And so what we're going to do is

429
01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:02.820
Brian Nguyen: Change that you share the desktop.

430
01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:07.350
To the Chrome

431
01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:10.050
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so

432
01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:14.970
Brian Nguyen: These once you get your results and put Google Drive.

433
01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:20.130
Brian Nguyen: It was nice to have to create your own excel sheet.

434
01:05:23.070 --> 01:05:34.440
Brian Nguyen: Gg just typically way to get your results. Right. So think of it, the calculation ensure raw data, and then you're going to process that data. Okay.

435
01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:37.920
All right. Thank you.

436
01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:45.120
Brian Nguyen: All right. Alright, so

437
01:05:49.290 --> 01:06:03.360
Brian Nguyen: Can you guys still would check your numbers mine. So one of the things that you like to do is reproduce the ability you guys get to reproduce your results right and if we said that game.

438
01:06:04.530 --> 01:06:09.210
Brian Nguyen: Alright set with the units are what we call our tree.

439
01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:10.770
Brian Nguyen: Yes.

440
01:06:12.090 --> 01:06:15.810
Aakrsh: How close, should they be about, like, I use bendy.

441
01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:17.940
Aakrsh: And for

442
01:06:18.270 --> 01:06:21.180
Aakrsh: Them on where I got like nine to 31

443
01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:23.550
To 35

444
01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.690
Brian Nguyen: Okay, well,

445
01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:31.200
Brian Nguyen: How about everyone out with this see

446
01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:33.150
Brian Nguyen: Close to them.

447
01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:38.100
Brian Nguyen: I see a crib sheet.

448
01:06:38.550 --> 01:06:39.480
Aakrsh: Number my

449
01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.860
Aakrsh: Number was like maybe

450
01:06:40.890 --> 01:06:44.550
230 1.6844

451
01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:48.810
Brian Nguyen: Hi, Chris, how about everyone else.

452
01:07:05.790 --> 01:07:06.510
Brian Nguyen: Victoria.

453
01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:14.340
Victoria Choi: Teresa.

454
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:17.310
Brian Nguyen: Okay, okay.

455
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:23.130
Brian Nguyen: Ah. Alright, well, we'll take a step back.

456
01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:28.650
Brian Nguyen: Then I assume you guys already really compete these energies right so

457
01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:31.230
Brian Nguyen: It's still back

458
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:34.890
Brian Nguyen: Go back to the terminal.

459
01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:38.190
Brian Nguyen: I'll go over one last time.

460
01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:45.660
Brian Nguyen: Really to get. Okay. I have a folder I ran with you guys.

461
01:07:46.770 --> 01:07:50.910
Brian Nguyen: Know of Kobe. Alright, so I had to leave. I ran

462
01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:55.560
Brian Nguyen: I ran Benji.

463
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.470
Okay.

464
01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:01.140
Brian Nguyen: All right.

465
01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:05.700
Brian Nguyen: I'll go over

466
01:08:07.290 --> 01:08:10.620
Brian Nguyen: One calculation day is he

467
01:08:13.770 --> 01:08:25.830
Brian Nguyen: Basically new okay so having fresh, fresh start, basically. Okay, just follow along, go over a little bit faster this time around an overview for everyone.

468
01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:31.740
Brian Nguyen: So just prepping your calculation you have your XYZ coordinates here.

469
01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:42.930
Brian Nguyen: Knowledge. Look at that file. I can see I order XYZ file, file that is a practice is some tips that little bit

470
01:08:43.950 --> 01:09:00.030
Brian Nguyen: A control see that line, right. So you'll see that coordinates for that. So you need to put this in the format turbo mall, the water XYZ file is that file is I'll put a gradient output to a file.

471
01:09:01.230 --> 01:09:04.890
Brian Nguyen: I will concede called Court or any name you want to call it. Okay.

472
01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:09.540
Brian Nguyen: All right, so just if you can

473
01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:17.430
Brian Nguyen: Have to say before I continue on to this help cool over a fresh start to get the energy

474
01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:21.900
Brian Nguyen: Up. Okay, it's not

475
01:09:23.490 --> 01:09:26.160
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so I'll go over it and all right.

476
01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:32.340
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so now you generate the coordinate files interval, we're going to run define

477
01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:43.050
Brian Nguyen: Define generates molecular or those are essentially our starting point. Okay, so that we run our calculations run define

478
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:48.600
Brian Nguyen: Enter Saturday title if that

479
01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:58.500
Brian Nguyen: We input the file in a court where the file name is ok that option is right here. Remember that

480
01:09:59.910 --> 01:10:02.730
Brian Nguyen: And to see that you input your atoms.

481
01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:12.900
Brian Nguyen: If you like you can use desi a taker dangers of the cemetery of the molecule. Okay. And they will do either.

482
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:15.150
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

483
01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:25.920
Brian Nguyen: Changes the coordinate system right since we've done that to start to terminate always look at the bottom option. Typically when you terminate.

484
01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.580
Brian Nguyen: This is the basis that BL

485
01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:40.440
Brian Nguyen: Right, so we checked up, he said. I said, used to TCP initiative basis it def se prints up. That's not the basis that you want.

486
01:10:41.610 --> 01:10:52.230
Brian Nguyen: I know that there's an error, where you guys all kind of assigned a business in this window here I can see all deaf to GDP. Do not do it in that one day. All right.

487
01:10:54.990 --> 01:11:00.600
Brian Nguyen: This is the window that you want to add your basis. That will be all SSP TV.

488
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:07.620
Brian Nguyen: Alright finds the basis that BL will see that right. Okay.

489
01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:12.750
Brian Nguyen: Terminate

490
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:24.420
Brian Nguyen: I know you can generate your molecular orbital. Generally, we're going to use this most cases. And there were, there may be some special cases. But for now uses case PhD.

491
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:30.930
Brian Nguyen: Yet default medically charging zero

492
01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:33.090
Brian Nguyen: Yes.

493
01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:41.880
Brian Nguyen: Alright so that turns your molecular orbital. Right. So, never. Good to see you. Say you want to turn this on.

494
01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:46.830
Brian Nguyen: And when to change the functional TPS ah

495
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.860
Brian Nguyen: Alright, the star.

496
01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.240
Brian Nguyen: And then we're going to do.

497
01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:58.650
Brian Nguyen: We're going to turn RI up to speed up the calculations.

498
01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:03.810
Brian Nguyen: When you can you always should use it turned on right

499
01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:20.820
Brian Nguyen: And we want to use this black thing here DSP dispersion correction, because the empty by itself doesn't accurately predict dispersion interaction. Very well. We're going to add this is keyword

500
01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:24.450
Brian Nguyen: DSP. We're going to use this

501
01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.230
Brian Nguyen: This correction BJ. Alright.

502
01:12:31.290 --> 01:12:35.250
Brian Nguyen: Car contaminate this window starts to make this window.

503
01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:46.530
Brian Nguyen: You're looking to file and have the file docs daily basis is when you kind of are I your basis is when you use the basis that okay this is like your

504
01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:56.070
Brian Nguyen: Control Center where you can nullify all the parameters in your corner file is your microwavable okay

505
01:12:57.150 --> 01:12:57.540
Brian Nguyen: Now,

506
01:12:58.710 --> 01:13:01.860
Brian Nguyen: In your path when we very first started we use job.

507
01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:06.660
Brian Nguyen: All right before you enter in Java. Java stash RI

508
01:13:07.890 --> 01:13:13.080
Brian Nguyen: What this job. Excuse me, do the math, and what's the, what did looking for

509
01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:16.080
Brian Nguyen: Remember,

510
01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:32.220
Brian Nguyen: Okay okay to be wrong. You don't worry that you know it's okay to make mistakes, right. So what do you, what do you think the job is, do let me run that

511
01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:36.660
Brian Nguyen: Command. What's it looking for

512
01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:45.780
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so if you for some structure right

513
01:13:47.130 --> 01:13:48.540
Brian Nguyen: What, what type of structure.

514
01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:00.030
Brian Nguyen: Remember,

515
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:24.600
Brian Nguyen: Ground state structures is that does that ring a bell. It's not a community that really yeah the downstate structured it optimizes structure to find the ground state strip the lowest energy. Okay, well, we don't want to do that right now. You just wanted us is given a

516
01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:26.880
Brian Nguyen: We show you what I mean.

517
01:14:28.710 --> 01:14:29.670
Brian Nguyen: To your whiteboard.

518
01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:32.910
Brian Nguyen: cleared this

519
01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:34.560
Brian Nguyen: Drawing

520
01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:40.170
Brian Nguyen: One good example is we have a water molecule.

521
01:14:41.670 --> 01:14:42.480
Brian Nguyen: Sorry for that.

522
01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:53.130
Brian Nguyen: Structures right

523
01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:57.480
Brian Nguyen: You're gonna make a prediction.

524
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:05.940
Brian Nguyen: Structure has a higher energy or more positive with the one

525
01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:18.990
Brian Nguyen: Wish structure, do you think will be hiring energy one on the left or on the right.

526
01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:23.730
Brian Nguyen: Shot.

527
01:15:26.850 --> 01:15:32.280
Brian Nguyen: 20 think has higher is going to be higher in energy or less stable.

528
01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:49.440
Brian Nguyen: For my hypothesis.

529
01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:06.480
Brian Nguyen: One on the

530
01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.140
Brian Nguyen: Table one on the

531
01:16:11.550 --> 01:16:13.560
Brian Nguyen: Other hand, the rate is less stable.

532
01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:15.210
Brian Nguyen: Yeah.

533
01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:19.530
Brian Nguyen: True. And that's because it's on the

534
01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:22.260
Brian Nguyen: Right, energy, though, is

535
01:16:23.790 --> 01:16:30.840
Brian Nguyen: Is a much higher. And this is configuration, the wet job. Next, does that job at

536
01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:40.170
Brian Nguyen: These have the initial setup here this initial structure are you studying point job X does

537
01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:51.780
Brian Nguyen: Is it tries WELL THAT DOES HIS DESK. I would try to define the ground state or lower energy structure. Okay.

538
01:16:52.770 --> 01:17:10.860
Brian Nguyen: And so it was changed to kind of modify this bond ID run through some several iterations eat at the structure. All right, now for, for our purposes, but I want you guys to do is not your own job that so I want you guys to one single point energy calculation.

539
01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:15.870
Brian Nguyen: This is what we call our I

540
01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:18.630
Brian Nguyen: E

541
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.580
G.

542
01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:22.800
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

543
01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:30.510
Brian Nguyen: Giving a structure or configuration won't repeat the energy for this given configuration. Right.

544
01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:32.940
Brian Nguyen: Same thing here.

545
01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:34.320
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

546
01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:47.760
Brian Nguyen: Does that answer your question here that clarify something often comes up is the reaction to all right. Okay. Well, I'm sure that everyone from the team. All right.

547
01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:51.240
Brian Nguyen: Okay, let's go back to our terminal.

548
01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:58.620
Brian Nguyen: Right, so we do not learn to one job. So now we're going to do is you're gonna run R. I.

549
01:17:59.670 --> 01:18:00.270
Brian Nguyen: P of t.

550
01:18:01.530 --> 01:18:04.890
Brian Nguyen: And when I'll put it out to file call rip it out.

551
01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:23.010
Brian Nguyen: Right when I go into beginning and we can add no hell no, hang up to run our calculation in the background. So if you log out with petered calculation was still still run. Okay, you put in person running in the background. Enter.

552
01:18:24.210 --> 01:18:30.570
Brian Nguyen: Again, this is Mark was a small the calculations Andre quickly. Okay, the output file.

553
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:35.220
Brian Nguyen: Or ideas key to look at that file.

554
01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:37.590
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

555
01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:40.110
Brian Nguyen: Can

556
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:52.440
Brian Nguyen: Everyone following along, learning their own define kind of idea to themselves. Okay.

557
01:18:53.490 --> 01:18:54.660
Brian Nguyen: No problem so far.

558
01:18:56.550 --> 01:18:59.430
Brian Nguyen: Okay. Okay, so just know the difference between those two.

559
01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:11.220
Brian Nguyen: So we go structure is the information a corner just kind of go over it again is the basis sets that we we try and remember

560
01:19:13.410 --> 01:19:21.330
Brian Nguyen: And very big basis that are we turned on. You found your take advantage of cemetery post a calculation.

561
01:19:22.410 --> 01:19:40.800
Brian Nguyen: I said it's going down to just the energy. So each iteration some energy, right, so first cycle it ran just energy wasted energy and it's going to adjust the older adult a little bit to find the most optimal orbitals, you kind of get you the lowest energy. All right.

562
01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:45.870
Brian Nguyen: So it goes through some iteration you see that entity goes down.

563
01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:53.850
Brian Nguyen: There iterations goes down again for continually now this one going going

564
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:58.590
Brian Nguyen: Going now is convert right so it's conversion in the sense that

565
01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:07.710
Brian Nguyen: After a certain number of decimal places the energy doesn't change very much. And that's the threshold, we call okay like 10 to the minus six.

566
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:23.700
Brian Nguyen: And then does it last iteration is your total energy just like you're looking for. And you can use this energy to compete your binding energy. Alright, so this is the cobra energy for your water molecule. Alright.

567
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:29.820
Brian Nguyen: Hopefully everyone you get about the same, same, same number. All right.

568
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:32.520
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

569
01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:37.590
Brian Nguyen: Just kind of get a feel. Everyone's funny waters. Right. Correct.

570
01:20:38.850 --> 01:20:42.030
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so everyone gets this number.

571
01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:49.230
Brian Nguyen: And 6.4 or 562 ALL RIGHT TO THE ANSWER A Christians question.

572
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:57.000
Brian Nguyen: Is should be within like if if all the parameters to everyone uses are the same.

573
01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:07.920
Brian Nguyen: It should be within almost like six digits after the decimal place. Okay, think so, I believe. Do you guys sell with to he everyone double check me

574
01:21:10.110 --> 01:21:10.440
Brian Nguyen: Yeah.

575
01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:20.490
Brian Nguyen: About the same. Yep. See, so so reproducibility is good in that case. Good. Alright, so

576
01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:23.490
Brian Nguyen: I think I ran

577
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:27.660
Brian Nguyen: This check, then

578
01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.930
Brian Nguyen: Okay, I'm gonna check fencing.

579
01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:51.000
Brian Nguyen: We're okay. So in this case I got negative 232 I think a Christian negative 231. So what I can view is I can

580
01:21:52.350 --> 01:22:13.740
Brian Nguyen: Share my control file feel crush you can take a look at that and see if our parameters are the same. Okay, so let me stop share and I'll add this to the chat and you guys can everyone can take that file and compare your control files. Okay.

581
01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:15.840
Brian Nguyen: All right.

582
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.960
Brian Nguyen: Good.

583
01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:45.720
Brian Nguyen: Survey. We everyone able to run these calculations or would they are you confused or I didn't get a email so

584
01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:49.740
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, totally. And what

585
01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:58.680
Theresa Carlos: I was just confused about where to like find the energy and I can

586
01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:02.700
Brian Nguyen: Okay, now you know where you get your energy. Okay.

587
01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:04.860
Brian Nguyen: Good luck to everyone can run it right

588
01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:13.950
Brian Nguyen: I just, you're just not sure where it is right. Okay, this is everybody had to go through everything began my bed.

589
01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:18.480
Brian Nguyen: Right at probably bored all your mind.

590
01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:22.290
Brian Nguyen: Maybe, yeah. And this control file.

591
01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:24.420
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so

592
01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:26.580
Brian Nguyen: The first a crash.

593
01:23:27.690 --> 01:23:30.180
Brian Nguyen: I sent that to everyone. I can check it out.

594
01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:34.770
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so let's go back and share the

595
01:23:35.850 --> 01:23:44.520
Brian Nguyen: Google Chrome. Alright, so can you guys all is everyone advanta calculation. Maybe we can check some of the calculation we get

596
01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:48.300
Brian Nguyen: Right. Can you, can everyone check this energy

597
01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:53.370
Brian Nguyen: Supposedly, that should be in your RFP out

598
01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:55.170
Brian Nguyen: File.

599
01:23:58.530 --> 01:23:59.940
Brian Nguyen: This is the energy. I got

600
01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:18.630
Brian Nguyen: If this energy is off by more than my in like the one that's good. Generally, it should be up to six digits.

601
01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:23.310
Brian Nguyen: These calculations are very, very precise.

602
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:27.090
Brian Nguyen: Accurate precise. Okay.

603
01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:33.510
Brian Nguyen: me double check with everyone.

604
01:24:38.850 --> 01:24:40.020
Brian Nguyen: Can we get the same number.

605
01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:41.820
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

606
01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:48.540
Theresa Carlos: I can't see that energy

607
01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:58.140
Brian Nguyen: Possibility. Are you under a computer.

608
01:25:00.030 --> 01:25:02.790
Brian Nguyen: Okay, second want a

609
01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:07.230
Brian Nguyen: You don't see it rip it out file.

610
01:25:08.850 --> 01:25:10.560
Theresa Carlos: I do. Okay.

611
01:25:11.310 --> 01:25:18.600
Brian Nguyen: Let's look at it. Okay, how about this share with share your screen, you might have it might be a good moment to kind of show everyone

612
01:25:22.110 --> 01:25:28.800
Brian Nguyen: Has their areas are bound to happen. And I think, be able to see it will help a lot. All right.

613
01:25:31.050 --> 01:25:31.680
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

614
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:36.450
Brian Nguyen: Look at our ideas here.

615
01:25:41.190 --> 01:25:42.930
Brian Nguyen: Okay, we can

616
01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:46.260
Brian Nguyen: Do here we

617
01:25:47.490 --> 01:25:49.080
Brian Nguyen: Go everyone taking a look great.

618
01:25:50.490 --> 01:25:50.850
Theresa Carlos: Oh,

619
01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:52.710
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

620
01:25:53.790 --> 01:26:06.810
Brian Nguyen: All right, here's a step. All right, it gives you an air right it's an option dollar sign on Friday, not found RSVP ended know normally RDP and abnormally programs.

621
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:21.390
Brian Nguyen: That mean your calculations crashed. Right, so I will open it up to everyone else. I know exactly with areas. So what do you think is there. What you see what is Teresa and Mrs.

622
01:26:49.530 --> 01:26:51.120
Brian Nguyen: Yes, because

623
01:26:52.650 --> 01:26:55.350
Victoria Choi: She forget to turn on our

624
01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:01.290
Brian Nguyen: Okay, that's a possibility. Right on. We are you think

625
01:27:05.370 --> 01:27:07.350
thanh: Yeah, same thing is Victoria said

626
01:27:08.370 --> 01:27:09.270
Brian Nguyen: Alright, that's fine.

627
01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:15.480
Brian Nguyen: Right, right, right. Lisa and accretion analogy there.

628
01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:20.340
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so let's get out

629
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:22.650
Brian Nguyen: All right.

630
01:27:23.850 --> 01:27:25.050
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so

631
01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:34.380
Brian Nguyen: Here's another okay so here's another group right so the one waking tech is go through define it's one define

632
01:27:38.490 --> 01:27:42.060
Brian Nguyen: Enter, Enter. Thank you going

633
01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:52.860
Brian Nguyen: Are we don't want to edit it just gets this not adding that we're not editing the imagery or adding more coordinate. We're not editing that basis fit.

634
01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:55.800
Brian Nguyen: Into know. Yep.

635
01:27:57.420 --> 01:28:03.810
Brian Nguyen: We're not editing them like the orbital all same folder contains all right let's go to our

636
01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:10.590
Brian Nguyen: PC.

637
01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:20.250
Brian Nguyen: There we go. Okay. Good job to go ahead and count. Yeah, there you go.

638
01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:27.720
Brian Nguyen: Very good.

639
01:28:32.190 --> 01:28:39.120
Brian Nguyen: Now you also notice that it January a file called oxidative right that's another clue that you know

640
01:28:40.230 --> 01:28:51.060
Brian Nguyen: You turn on RI right you don't have that file available to you didn't turn in turn. All right. Okay, so these are you just think that we kind of go over. I'm going to try to keep

641
01:28:52.350 --> 01:29:03.330
Brian Nguyen: Having you guys find these areas for yourself. Right, right, kind of practice. Right. Okay, so you can we run that calculation again and come back to later.

642
01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:05.100
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

643
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:12.330
Theresa Carlos: Another question I had. I'm sorry. No. Say someone my energy like this one doesn't. So

644
01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:25.050
Brian Nguyen: That because you have to run the RDP option. And when our up all the energy file abrogated prints out the cycles, the energy, the total energy cycle.

645
01:29:26.010 --> 01:29:26.400
Okay.

646
01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:31.590
Brian Nguyen: All right, cool.

647
01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:38.250
Brian Nguyen: Other questions about running your calculation. All right.

648
01:29:39.810 --> 01:29:40.410
Brian Nguyen: Good.

649
01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:43.980
Brian Nguyen: Go back to Google Chrome

650
01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:45.660
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

651
01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:51.000
Brian Nguyen: So we'd all been done correctly on this check the bending.

652
01:29:52.590 --> 01:29:56.850
Brian Nguyen: The one that is a game engine and your score died.

653
01:30:03.330 --> 01:30:06.300
Aakrsh: Mr Brian also figured out why my number loom off.

654
01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:11.280
Brian Nguyen: Okay, you like to share to the group, maybe what why is it off or

655
01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:23.670
Aakrsh: I think I i think i clicked something wrong, because maybe I read it wrong or wrote it down wrong the first time you can I just went back into it and looked at it and it was negative 230 2.2

656
01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:28.830
Brian Nguyen: Okay to 30

657
01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:37.080
Aakrsh: Because I had, I had negative 231 point 64 written down, but when I went back to the program because my computer just died and went back up.

658
01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:40.710
Brian Nguyen: Okay, welcome back.

659
01:30:41.790 --> 01:30:42.240
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

660
01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:43.860
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, it could happen.

661
01:30:46.230 --> 01:30:48.660
Brian Nguyen: To me 368 26

662
01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:51.090
Aakrsh: Did I think

663
01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:52.500
Brian Nguyen: Yeah.

664
01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:53.700
Aakrsh: I'm sorry. Yeah.

665
01:30:54.690 --> 01:30:55.140
Okay.

666
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:56.610
Brian Nguyen: Yeah.

667
01:30:56.670 --> 01:31:02.610
Brian Nguyen: Give me a heart attack. Prove it, right. That's good. All right. Good. Good. Okay, so

668
01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:11.880
Brian Nguyen: We should all get pretty much the same energy. Right. So double checking everyone give me a nod to the yacht, the

669
01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:16.470
Brian Nguyen: Correct total energy, the same for every day I competed

670
01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:19.770
Brian Nguyen: In

671
01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:23.280
Brian Nguyen: Their career again.

672
01:31:24.810 --> 01:31:25.680
Theresa Carlos: I say also

673
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:30.540
Theresa Carlos: It's like we won something

674
01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:35.310
Brian Nguyen: All right.

675
01:31:38.010 --> 01:31:39.750
Brian Nguyen: Ready to go back and put their picture they

676
01:31:42.090 --> 01:31:43.290
Theresa Carlos: Should I share my screen.

677
01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:44.040
Yeah.

678
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:10.380
Brian Nguyen: Oh, okay.

679
01:32:12.210 --> 01:32:13.860
Brian Nguyen: What could happen is

680
01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:22.260
Brian Nguyen: I'm sorry, but I think I gave you an updated structure. It wasn't copied over

681
01:32:24.090 --> 01:32:30.990
Brian Nguyen: So it could be what happened every I attended an updated for interns folders.

682
01:32:32.970 --> 01:32:46.500
Brian Nguyen: That Friday or so lesson and 30 I think we had you're running a different structure. Okay, well, what will get back to it. All right. Okay.

683
01:32:49.770 --> 01:32:52.560
Brian Nguyen: Amy, it is the most important thing I wanted to show

684
01:32:53.670 --> 01:33:00.000
Brian Nguyen: Is this. Remember the three different configuration are venting

685
01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:02.610
Brian Nguyen: venting where you have it.

686
01:33:02.970 --> 01:33:11.340
Brian Nguyen: Basically over right on top of each other. The venting where you're kind of stacked it me, let me show you a picture. You don't mess you better

687
01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:17.580
Brian Nguyen: We open up the other guy, Joe. Alright, so let me open

688
01:33:18.810 --> 01:33:21.000
Brian Nguyen: Just so you guys everyone to see.

689
01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:24.540
Brian Nguyen: Structures when I'm talking to them.

690
01:33:28.230 --> 01:33:29.610
Brian Nguyen: All right, so I'm open to it.

691
01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:31.320
Brian Nguyen: Gotcha.

692
01:33:32.370 --> 01:33:32.790
Brian Nguyen: Actually

693
01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:36.420
Brian Nguyen: This one was either

694
01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:39.120
Brian Nguyen: Writing copy cutter.

695
01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:49.890
Brian Nguyen: And it's the t shirt. Okay. So remember that question. You were talking about was which bending dimer is the

696
01:33:52.110 --> 01:33:56.820
Brian Nguyen: Lowest or ground state energy or more stable. Right. So this one is are staggered

697
01:33:58.020 --> 01:34:01.620
Brian Nguyen: All right, so give you a visual everyone is digital

698
01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:06.000
Brian Nguyen: Right okay then.

699
01:34:07.050 --> 01:34:07.560
Brian Nguyen: Structure.

700
01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:09.030
Brian Nguyen: And

701
01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:11.880
Brian Nguyen: Get you to a structure for you.

702
01:34:13.470 --> 01:34:13.920
Brian Nguyen: Do

703
01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:23.100
Brian Nguyen: Alright, this is the one that we, the death where it's completely right on top of each other. Okay.

704
01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:25.770
Brian Nguyen: All right.

705
01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:27.720
Brian Nguyen: Now, last one.

706
01:34:29.250 --> 01:34:29.850
Brian Nguyen: This one.

707
01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:38.790
Brian Nguyen: This funky thing where, like, it forms it a T shaped with the engineering

708
01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:49.410
Brian Nguyen: Right and our hypothesis was that this thing the stack one was the most stable right

709
01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:53.670
Brian Nguyen: Unfortunately, that's not not the case.

710
01:34:54.840 --> 01:35:03.510
Brian Nguyen: People are published papers on this that the the sex ring here. He did a sacrament. A T shaped

711
01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:10.710
Brian Nguyen: Dimer Venturi is the lowest and energy or more stable.

712
01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:17.820
Brian Nguyen: And we're going to try to verify that and confirm that with our calculations. And if you look at it.

713
01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:24.900
Brian Nguyen: Here's our binary energy is the calculation I competed I just wrote a little excel sheet.

714
01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:27.660
Brian Nguyen: The 15

715
01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:31.290
Brian Nguyen: Oh, sorry. I should have done the other way around.

716
01:35:32.490 --> 01:35:35.040
Brian Nguyen: You're supposed to be my dad.

717
01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:39.690
Brian Nguyen: Some of those guys mind species.

718
01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:43.290
Brian Nguyen: Should be taught.

719
01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:48.300
Brian Nguyen: My bed. Okay.

720
01:35:53.430 --> 01:36:03.420
Brian Nguyen: Okay, the more positive and more stronger than binding between to accomplish the team de Monaco daily more stable. Right. So you can see here

721
01:36:05.310 --> 01:36:10.590
Brian Nguyen: The benzene dimer ran off each other. It's almost like kilocalories per mole.

722
01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:14.340
Brian Nguyen: Weaker be nice to shape.

723
01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:24.330
Brian Nguyen: This thing is unit conversion here 67.509, you can always look up the unit conversion. So always

724
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:26.280
Brian Nguyen: Been hard

725
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:29.850
Brian Nguyen: To kilocalories per ml.

726
01:36:32.850 --> 01:36:44.520
Brian Nguyen: Okay and here's this the unit conversion. Alright, so for everyone who are tree. There's 627.59 calories per mole. Okay, so just remember it.

727
01:36:46.050 --> 01:36:46.860
Brian Nguyen: Chemistry stuff.

728
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:48.750
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

729
01:36:51.150 --> 01:36:55.650
Brian Nguyen: So pretty cool, right, we were able to confirm the calculation that we did that.

730
01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:17.730
Brian Nguyen: At the structure that we have is a staggered form or T shaped slower and energy than the dimer itself, the one that's right on top of each other. Right. This is where we observe, are these energies we compete it but then it you know you can compete with energy, but no.

731
01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:35.520
Brian Nguyen: CDs trends, what does it really mean, and why are the numbers are. So this is an active area of research, right, we're still working on everyone's working on. Alright. Alright, so what we thought about

732
01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:38.700
Brian Nguyen: Time to disappear. No.

733
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:45.840
Brian Nguyen: That's it. That's all I want to show you guys. I'm gonna share this Excel sheet with us, everyone.

734
01:37:47.010 --> 01:37:52.740
Brian Nguyen: So you can check your numbers right and to see how I actually complete these numbers. Okay.

735
01:37:54.210 --> 01:37:54.570
Brian Nguyen: All right.

736
01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:57.240
Brian Nguyen: The few other things to note

737
01:37:58.410 --> 01:38:01.680
Brian Nguyen: Back in chemistry. We didn't know that.

738
01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:06.150
Brian Nguyen: That Bindi energy that you know Vander Waal

739
01:38:07.230 --> 01:38:24.630
Brian Nguyen: Is typically weaker than hydrogen bonding. Right. Correct. But if you're if you're molecule is big enough very big, it can reach up to the same Viney energy as your water diner. Okay, so remember ethane.

740
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:38.220
Brian Nguyen: And decades. Right. I just adding more carbon to it. You can see that it can, it's approaching the binding energy of water. Okay.

741
01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:39.960
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

742
01:38:41.010 --> 01:38:44.550
Brian Nguyen: So that's another thing. Nice to nice thing to see where you can

743
01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:50.190
Brian Nguyen: Verify what you learned in your chemistry class. Okay.

744
01:38:52.230 --> 01:38:53.100
Brian Nguyen: Ask questions. Yes.

745
01:38:55.710 --> 01:38:57.720
Brian Nguyen: All right, it's okay.

746
01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:00.090
Brian Nguyen: If you dad.

747
01:39:01.290 --> 01:39:02.460
Brian Nguyen: Yes, one minute.

748
01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:08.820
Brian Nguyen: One last thing is be able to visualize somebody molecular orbital.

749
01:39:10.530 --> 01:39:12.060
Brian Nguyen: What we're gonna do is

750
01:39:15.090 --> 01:39:18.540
Brian Nguyen: I'm assuming airborne has ran a water calculations. Correct.

751
01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:28.290
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so what we're going to do is when I generate and molecular orbital for water calculation. So you can visualize it.

752
01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:34.890
Brian Nguyen: And then it's not time if you guys give everyone a little assignments.

753
01:39:36.450 --> 01:39:45.120
Brian Nguyen: Get started on it. And if you guys if you really wanted to continue working on it. I had talked to me about it, feel free to email me. Okay.

754
01:39:46.290 --> 01:39:50.820
Brian Nguyen: All right, so you go to terminal to terminal.

755
01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:55.770
Brian Nguyen: One.

756
01:39:58.530 --> 01:39:59.910
Brian Nguyen: Hello. Okay.

757
01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:03.600
Brian Nguyen: You're back on to our computer

758
01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:14.160
Brian Nguyen: This new water. Okay, water, it's easy to work with. We have a converged energy or destruction of our optimum.

759
01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.640
Brian Nguyen: You can then type in Tiger.

760
01:40:19.230 --> 01:40:19.650
Brian Nguyen: Tiger.

761
01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:26.520
Brian Nguyen: Your dance print out all the occupation of here likely or okay

762
01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:31.950
Brian Nguyen: All right, face to kind of

763
01:40:32.970 --> 01:40:36.780
Brian Nguyen: Go to very end. Right. Okay. So, this

764
01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:40.380
Brian Nguyen: Shows you the total energy

765
01:40:41.970 --> 01:40:43.830
Brian Nguyen: You know, our trees and electron volts.

766
01:40:44.850 --> 01:40:51.180
Brian Nguyen: It gives you the energy of the molecular interesting highs often little and the lowest or not, combined with

767
01:40:53.790 --> 01:40:55.020
Brian Nguyen: Your seat that

768
01:40:56.730 --> 01:40:58.260
Brian Nguyen: Either occupational nurse.

769
01:41:00.090 --> 01:41:08.280
Brian Nguyen: I believe if everyone remembers how many electrons can occupy on multiple orbital molecular

770
01:41:09.870 --> 01:41:11.040
Brian Nguyen: Or any over it.

771
01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:20.310
Brian Nguyen: Was a member there, and I hope you guys learned that in AP chemistry.

772
01:41:21.630 --> 01:41:23.280
Brian Nguyen: Here filling up their electronic

773
01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:54.750
Brian Nguyen: Nodding. Okay. Yeah, that's right. It's that for each leg or Adobe enough to electron occupying it right they occupying spin up and spin down. Right. Okay.

774
01:41:57.420 --> 01:42:01.050
Brian Nguyen: And since they're all kind of saying oh really yeah they have generally the same energy.

775
01:42:04.110 --> 01:42:06.090
Brian Nguyen: So what we're gonna do is we're gonna try to visualize

776
01:42:07.770 --> 01:42:13.920
Brian Nguyen: The hall and the limo. All right. To do that, we are

777
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.920
Brian Nguyen: Asked to do is

778
01:42:18.090 --> 01:42:23.580
Brian Nguyen: We have to modify. We were at by hand in our

779
01:42:26.250 --> 01:42:29.670
Brian Nguyen: In our control file. Okay, so the control

780
01:42:35.250 --> 01:42:39.540
Brian Nguyen: Point, you take this command in. So this wine is called point style.

781
01:42:42.450 --> 01:42:42.990
Brian Nguyen: Mo.

782
01:42:44.610 --> 01:42:50.550
Brian Nguyen: And then I believe you're testing the molecular orbital that you're interested in.

783
01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:57.450
Brian Nguyen: You put a grieving you plan before you put that format it to keep

784
01:42:58.710 --> 01:42:59.730
Really, okay.

785
01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:04.170
Brian Nguyen: Equal mo state.

786
01:43:05.850 --> 01:43:08.670
Brian Nguyen: Mo. Number five, and

787
01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:15.930
Brian Nguyen: OK, now let's save this.

788
01:43:17.310 --> 01:43:23.640
Brian Nguyen: Calling cute W you type in Poland W Q will say in quick edit, same time

789
01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:31.680
Brian Nguyen: All right, and it corresponds to these numbers. Okay, five, and six.

790
01:43:32.730 --> 01:43:37.950
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so to get these orbitals. Move on our idea to

791
01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:40.440
Brian Nguyen: Cash proper

792
01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:53.160
Brian Nguyen: Put this out to a call proper output that you guys can everyone can see what if there's an error. Right.

793
01:43:54.210 --> 01:43:54.750
Brian Nguyen: Center.

794
01:43:56.130 --> 01:43:59.790
Brian Nguyen: Okay. And if she shows up haha there. You did.

795
01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:02.370
Brian Nguyen: Use the orbital.

796
01:44:03.810 --> 01:44:07.320
Brian Nguyen: Alright, this is correspond to disrupt orbital here for a one.

797
01:44:08.850 --> 01:44:10.050
Brian Nguyen: And one, the two

798
01:44:11.370 --> 01:44:11.850
Brian Nguyen: Right here.

799
01:44:13.290 --> 01:44:13.710
Brian Nguyen: All right.

800
01:44:15.150 --> 01:44:19.680
Brian Nguyen: When I say, Okay, what's this proper de VI proper

801
01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:25.080
Brian Nguyen: Out. Now, feel free to stop me at any moment.

802
01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:28.410
Brian Nguyen: I can go back and look at it again.

803
01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:38.340
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so is this the same thing. What this does, that doesn't run the energy calculation is just print out the molecular old rules for you. Okay.

804
01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:41.310
Brian Nguyen: You can see them right here and maybe show you

805
01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:48.270
Brian Nguyen: doesn't run any energy calculation. So there's no energy calculation is it

806
01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:52.380
Brian Nguyen: Quiet dealing. Is it right is running this file here.

807
01:44:53.790 --> 01:45:01.410
Brian Nguyen: contain them like the overall for you. This is this information. All right, doesn't take too long. Danny's calculations. A quick. Okay.

808
01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:12.300
Brian Nguyen: So what we're gonna do is what we always been doing is we're going to have to copy this file back to our, our computer. Okay.

809
01:45:14.550 --> 01:45:17.490
Brian Nguyen: Alright so let me share my desktop, you can see

810
01:45:20.490 --> 01:45:21.300
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so

811
01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:27.570
Brian Nguyen: What was the command to copy files from one computer to another.

812
01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:38.130
Victoria Choi: SAP

813
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:39.750
Brian Nguyen: Great. Right.

814
01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:42.660
Brian Nguyen: I will constantly review and yeah everyone

815
01:45:43.110 --> 01:45:45.330
Brian Nguyen: You know what, what commands are there. OK.

816
01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:57.450
Brian Nguyen: OK, so the STP. So we were going to work on our computer right now is our my computer name and I cannot go Peter, go to the directory that you want.

817
01:45:58.740 --> 01:45:59.340
Brian Nguyen: To

818
01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:18.360
Brian Nguyen: save that file. Okay, so I'm going to the record, I want to save my file. So you got everyone's go to directory that you want to save your calculations in. Okay. Alright, so I'm going to make a new folder will call it non Covina

819
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:23.850
Brian Nguyen: All right this way. I kind of organizing I think about

820
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:37.080
Brian Nguyen: Right, so like, you know, I'm in the first high school I read I put this in 2020 and break it up into different folders so everyone has their own way of organizing things that define what what works best for you because

821
01:46:38.250 --> 01:46:39.000
Brian Nguyen: The noncombatant

822
01:46:40.350 --> 01:46:47.610
Brian Nguyen: Right now it's empty. I want to make a folder water right water in there, put the water

823
01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:49.170
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

824
01:46:53.910 --> 01:46:56.460
Brian Nguyen: Now here's the real question. We know that STP.

825
01:46:57.660 --> 01:46:58.590
Brian Nguyen: How do we use it.

826
01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:00.630
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

827
01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:03.180
Brian Nguyen: And what is the

828
01:47:04.290 --> 01:47:21.510
Brian Nguyen: I'll show you one one, last one, last time, or yesterday. Everyone is triggered his outfit in the future. And when I asked you get everyone in how you run this command. Right. So from now on remembered a year. We are call is going to be copying files from

829
01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:28.380
Brian Nguyen: Where we are so from our local machine. Okay wait for our computer is ok so we SCP

830
01:47:29.610 --> 01:47:34.170
Brian Nguyen: Or Pepsi. I'm going to put this in my, you know, computer science language username.

831
01:47:36.150 --> 01:47:38.670
Brian Nguyen: Not your every wherever you're at UCI net ideas.

832
01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:48.630
Brian Nguyen: So we're going to start with this one because we're in a copy of file from the computer itself, your computer is use that to call IP address.

833
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:57.240
Brian Nguyen: Right, or we will use the computer name or in our case. Alright, so the IP address for our cases, the computer name.

834
01:47:59.430 --> 01:48:02.190
Brian Nguyen: dot p s e said E edu.

835
01:48:03.690 --> 01:48:11.610
Brian Nguyen: We're not done there that just points to the computer with your username. Okay. When you put a colon.

836
01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:25.080
Brian Nguyen: Go back to your directory here when we need to do is we need to specify 70 WD G, we need to specify where this file is

837
01:48:26.190 --> 01:48:28.290
Brian Nguyen: My commute appointed and it's copied us

838
01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:34.590
Brian Nguyen: So each everyone else has a different meaning out of 20 different more or less to be distinct

839
01:48:35.670 --> 01:48:52.710
Brian Nguyen: Ideas name. So I have it in here have been to water, but I want to copy GIS keep files. Alright, so there's several options. You can use this

840
01:48:55.140 --> 01:48:58.740
Brian Nguyen: One of the easy option is scar cube.

841
01:49:00.570 --> 01:49:08.790
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so let's start does is that star will list out call files that has these last three characters. Okay.

842
01:49:10.770 --> 01:49:12.270
Brian Nguyen: Then space.

843
01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:22.170
Brian Nguyen: This is the destination where you want to save it. So since I'm already in this folder here right here.

844
01:49:23.580 --> 01:49:25.320
Brian Nguyen: I can just press to period.

845
01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:27.090
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

846
01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:38.550
Brian Nguyen: Cuz remind everyone, the period copies to file into this folder here. Wherever you are right now. Okay. You can also

847
01:49:39.930 --> 01:49:41.730
Brian Nguyen: Write it out like this.

848
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:44.940
Brian Nguyen: And that will give you the same answer.

849
01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:49.470
Brian Nguyen: Okay, it was alright.

850
01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:55.320
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so everyone copy that key file back to your computer.

851
01:50:08.430 --> 01:50:09.630
Brian Nguyen: Feel free to ask questions.

852
01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:26.550
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

853
01:50:28.410 --> 01:50:35.850
Brian Nguyen: We're going to look at the homo, homo is the one that is the highest energy and occupied for this one. So one of the two

854
01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:37.260
Okay.

855
01:50:39.210 --> 01:50:47.610
Brian Nguyen: I have a setup where I can just type in GMT. So for you guys. Yes, for everyone. We're going to open up

856
01:50:49.470 --> 01:50:49.920
Brian Nguyen: The end.

857
01:50:50.970 --> 01:50:54.840
Brian Nguyen: I want to have a different version. Little bit believe to max.

858
01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:59.400
Brian Nguyen: Won't be will be a little different than mine.

859
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:06.270
Brian Nguyen: Believe that because the mecca with kind of Ina

860
01:51:07.620 --> 01:51:13.890
Brian Nguyen: That isn't compatible with this version of D amp D. So your end smells a little bit more fancy. Okay.

861
01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:18.030
Brian Nguyen: So what we're going to do is go to file.

862
01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:24.930
Brian Nguyen: We're going to load up all it alright so we're going to do new molecule.

863
01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:27.570
Brian Nguyen: Go to brown

864
01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:36.990
Brian Nguyen: Right. So this time, the information where you are to us. You might see. I haven't looked through this kind of gets messy.

865
01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:41.070
Brian Nguyen: For me, I'm in depth up

866
01:51:44.310 --> 01:51:47.130
Brian Nguyen: Me in high school outreach.

867
01:51:49.470 --> 01:51:51.480
Brian Nguyen: Non carbonated water.

868
01:51:52.980 --> 01:51:53.760
Brian Nguyen: Wants to be

869
01:51:55.410 --> 01:51:56.580
Brian Nguyen: Expressed load.

870
01:51:57.960 --> 01:52:00.090
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so here's my water Marco

871
01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:07.530
Brian Nguyen: And I stop here. Is everyone able to load their water molecule.

872
01:52:08.970 --> 01:52:15.690
Brian Nguyen: Not on here able to Korea. You're welcome. You say something

873
01:52:19.650 --> 01:52:20.700
Brian Nguyen: Are you able to load.

874
01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:26.310
Brian Nguyen: No, no worries.

875
01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:35.370
Theresa Carlos: Because my financing not responding to anything something

876
01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:38.430
Brian Nguyen: That I can

877
01:52:39.540 --> 01:52:43.020
Theresa Carlos: And I think just open because it wasn't responding

878
01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:44.370
Theresa Carlos: Again,

879
01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:47.010
Theresa Carlos: Okay.

880
01:52:48.210 --> 01:52:51.600
Brian Nguyen: Victoria. You like to share me your screen I can show

881
01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:53.070
Victoria Choi: Oh,

882
01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:57.660
Victoria Choi: I actually got it was hidden behind everything

883
01:53:00.810 --> 01:53:02.460
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so

884
01:53:03.150 --> 01:53:05.340
Brian Nguyen: We're going to change this display to

885
01:53:05.580 --> 01:53:11.130
Brian Nguyen: ortho ortho graphic. So it makes this little perpendicular and makes it easier to visualize

886
01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:15.960
Brian Nguyen: So we're gonna go to graphic representation

887
01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:17.610
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

888
01:53:19.740 --> 01:53:31.740
Brian Nguyen: Can everyone can kind of play around on the future. We've managed to see us. There's all different forms, different ways of characterizing this visualizing this thing.

889
01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:42.750
Brian Nguyen: Come on, nicer than others, right, it's one these foods. Maybe you just pro we all will see you can zoom out and okay

890
01:53:44.430 --> 01:53:47.430
Brian Nguyen: We're going to use licorice or you

891
01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:50.730
Brian Nguyen: typically use licorice first UK

892
01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:56.670
Brian Nguyen: UK might be a little bit more similar for you so that

893
01:53:57.720 --> 01:54:00.360
Brian Nguyen: Once that's done, let's create representation

894
01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:08.370
Brian Nguyen: Now you have to representation here right and it would I change this representation to

895
01:54:09.570 --> 01:54:10.830
Brian Nguyen: ISO surface.

896
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:12.360
Brian Nguyen: Right.

897
01:54:13.890 --> 01:54:27.180
Brian Nguyen: We get this little box here, I'm gonna do is understand the only the ISO surface here. Here is a show. Go to I specific draw go to solid

898
01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:43.590
Brian Nguyen: Alright so interesting. So this is some some math involved. So what we're gonna do. We're gonna change is a value. So that is related to, like, some kind of integration.

899
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:51.510
Brian Nguyen: Learn that eventually taking calculus. So we're going to do is point press point 03

900
01:54:52.530 --> 01:54:52.980
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

901
01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:55.410
Brian Nguyen: Let me get this

902
01:54:56.490 --> 01:55:00.810
Brian Nguyen: lobular thing, right. So we're going to change the color.

903
01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:03.150
Brian Nguyen: gold color method.

904
01:55:05.250 --> 01:55:14.640
Brian Nguyen: Because caller ID and a bunch of different colors, blue, red, green, orange book The clock want to keep it with blue and red. All right, make it simple.

905
01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:18.330
Brian Nguyen: Stop here.

906
01:55:21.330 --> 01:55:27.120
Brian Nguyen: Everyone nod or give me a thumbs up if you got

907
01:55:28.710 --> 01:55:32.340
Brian Nguyen: It. Alright, so now we're going to do the same thing.

908
01:55:34.290 --> 01:55:40.170
Brian Nguyen: Alright copy itself really make the native I still value. Don't do this to

909
01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:43.350
Brian Nguyen: The other side of the integration.

910
01:55:45.390 --> 01:55:54.660
Brian Nguyen: And then we're going to change the color system to read what up. Here's your first picture of your molecular orbital.

911
01:55:55.860 --> 01:56:01.050
Brian Nguyen: We can change. This is a value to make it smaller. Let's make it five.

912
01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:06.060
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so you see to Adams herself up here.

913
01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:09.360
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

914
01:56:11.370 --> 01:56:11.820
Brian Nguyen: Question.

915
01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:14.100
Brian Nguyen: All right, good.

916
01:56:15.150 --> 01:56:18.090
Brian Nguyen: Other things really do like a year.

917
01:56:19.590 --> 01:56:21.960
Brian Nguyen: Good graphics colors.

918
01:56:23.250 --> 01:56:27.900
Brian Nguyen: Change the background play back background. I've read. Number eight.

919
01:56:29.490 --> 01:56:31.350
Brian Nguyen: White. Then the second time.

920
01:56:32.670 --> 01:56:32.880
Brian Nguyen: He

921
01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:37.530
Brian Nguyen: Makes it a little bit easier to see the white background.

922
01:56:38.850 --> 01:56:39.300
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

923
01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:45.480
Brian Nguyen: We could make this look at all those little bit smaller 2.08

924
01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:51.690
Brian Nguyen: All right.

925
01:56:55.500 --> 01:57:02.760
Brian Nguyen: All right. Okay, here's your orbital originated in a situated. You want to look at it this way is the class.

926
01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:15.810
Brian Nguyen: If you just scroll. We have to zoom in on a little bit. Okay. And then, or know what this is great, but okay. Seriously. There we go.

927
01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:18.090
Brian Nguyen: Hey,

928
01:57:19.470 --> 01:57:24.120
Brian Nguyen: Here's I'm likely or will go to file is no lender this file.

929
01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:28.740
Brian Nguyen: Rendered

930
01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:31.170
Brian Nguyen: Right.

931
01:57:32.910 --> 01:57:38.160
Brian Nguyen: In most cases, we're going to use this thing here asking on

932
01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:47.130
Brian Nguyen: Okay, and that will render high quality pictures for you that can be used for publication.

933
01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:48.990
Brian Nguyen: Vendors

934
01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:54.210
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, high quality pictures.

935
01:57:55.980 --> 01:57:57.540
Brian Nguyen: Click on this or

936
01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:09.180
Brian Nguyen: I believe on a max maybe live different save this.

937
01:58:12.270 --> 01:58:13.050
Brian Nguyen: Safe as

938
01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:27.180
Brian Nguyen: I said this is this is a picture you're trying to say the one you have, we can now.

939
01:58:34.170 --> 01:58:34.530
Okay.

940
01:58:37.620 --> 01:58:38.940
Brian Nguyen: Max slightly different

941
01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:48.480
Brian Nguyen: Okay, that's fine. Right. So this is how you make high quality pictures. You can see for leave on a Windows. If you click on this.

942
01:58:49.590 --> 01:58:57.870
Brian Nguyen: Can be slightly different. You have a way to save it as a file. Make sure that your files in a PSD format. Okay.

943
01:58:59.250 --> 01:59:05.970
Brian Nguyen: Check out the format and and make sure that it's in PNG for a Mac. I believe it's going to have to do something.

944
01:59:06.990 --> 01:59:07.440
Brian Nguyen: Different

945
01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:11.220
Brian Nguyen: Don't know why.

946
01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:19.560
Brian Nguyen: But yeah, different methods can be a little different. I can figure that out for you guys, everyone like yeah

947
01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:26.160
Brian Nguyen: Okay, how you make your little right really quick that. Oh, wow.

948
01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:30.240
Brian Nguyen: Okay, well, there we go.

949
01:59:31.410 --> 01:59:35.910
Brian Nguyen: Okay, you make your me open this up one last time I screwed up.

950
01:59:39.330 --> 01:59:39.930
Brian Nguyen: With me

951
01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:49.320
Brian Nguyen: That's how you make your overdose. Right. That's how you can do it for

952
01:59:50.610 --> 01:59:52.980
Brian Nguyen: Each of your home own demo of water molecule.

953
01:59:55.410 --> 02:00:05.370
Brian Nguyen: The last thing I want to show wanted to ask you to run a calculation. I'm gonna stop sharing

954
02:00:06.780 --> 02:00:07.890
Brian Nguyen: Before we go

955
02:00:08.910 --> 02:00:12.660
Brian Nguyen: Any further questions about generating these molecular or no.

956
02:00:15.420 --> 02:00:20.760
Brian Nguyen: No. Okay, so if you have one last thing.

957
02:00:21.990 --> 02:00:35.550
Brian Nguyen: Via everyone can do this on your own. I'll send it in an email, but I'll say here and chat to you. But here's an interesting molecule. I like everyone to run is called the 286 molecule.

958
02:00:36.570 --> 02:00:41.430
Brian Nguyen: I want everyone to perform a geometry optimization

959
02:00:42.510 --> 02:00:53.250
Brian Nguyen: So this is kind of this will combine everything that you pretty much learned in the past weekend and apply to this. And then, you know, if you like this come back to me and we can talk about it.

960
02:00:54.420 --> 02:01:01.860
Brian Nguyen: With an email. So I everyone is some very interesting chemistry and you can interpret the bonding.

961
02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:09.390
Brian Nguyen: Based on visual and select the orbitals. I only showed you a water molecule and it's not much I can do to show

962
02:01:09.990 --> 02:01:31.890
Brian Nguyen: To show you how to do it. But now she wants you to apply it to see some interesting chemistry. Okay, so we're gonna do a performance, the optimization with to be functional will not figured out how to change that functional PB and depth to as the dataset.

963
02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:35.580
Brian Nguyen: Okay, I picked that in just

964
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:41.640
Brian Nguyen: For general conversation with me functional confirm

965
02:01:42.780 --> 02:01:45.300
Brian Nguyen: That you're that the

966
02:01:47.730 --> 02:01:48.870
Brian Nguyen: Geometry.

967
02:01:50.130 --> 02:01:52.140
Brian Nguyen: He's at eight grand scale.

968
02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:59.790
Brian Nguyen: How do you confirm that what was, what was the command or the next whatever we're looking at

969
02:02:03.630 --> 02:02:04.260
Brian Nguyen: You remember

970
02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:09.330
Brian Nguyen: It starts with a, oh boy.

971
02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:11.970
Theresa Carlos: Calculation.

972
02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:38.340
Brian Nguyen: Ok al for to calculate confirms that you whether you're at a grammar mistakes they make sure that your frequencies are non imaginary. So, meaning that there's no negative frequency. OK, and then print out

973
02:02:40.260 --> 02:02:43.650
Brian Nguyen: The hormones in numeral. Okay.

974
02:02:47.700 --> 02:02:48.780
Brian Nguyen: Molecular orbital.

975
02:02:52.950 --> 02:03:04.290
Brian Nguyen: Little things you will have to pretty much built them all to yourself, verify them all inclusive Google that. So this is very interesting structure your to do list.

976
02:03:06.270 --> 02:03:11.910
Brian Nguyen: All the rules are basically toss out of our earlier the window. Okay.

977
02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:33.510
Brian Nguyen: It's very interesting performance geography optimization with PB def to Sep basis that confirm that john Cusack ground state run a calculation to confirm that exam state and then print out me some molecular orbital is the whole mall in limbo. And then once you get to that scale.

978
02:03:34.890 --> 02:03:38.400
Brian Nguyen: And if you have questions, except, feel free to email me

979
02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:57.420
Brian Nguyen: Right. And, you know, feel free to to maybe ask more about what what what what you're visualizing what you see in a very interesting chemistry. You can see it's a very interesting bonding that you will see okay that you never really imagined about. Okay.

980
02:03:59.100 --> 02:03:59.370
Aakrsh: And

981
02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:03.000
Aakrsh: Bring when are we going to get the email for like where we are choices.

982
02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:13.740
Brian Nguyen: Okay, yeah, we'll get to that fact. You may have over logistics. Right. So what questions about this last

983
02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:15.360
Brian Nguyen: Little small assignments.

984
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:17.370
Brian Nguyen: Right.

985
02:04:17.430 --> 02:04:19.050
Brian Nguyen: It gave me a shot, you know,

986
02:04:19.290 --> 02:04:29.550
Brian Nguyen: Give it a try. That's another way of practicing and re applying a lot of the chemistry that we see from these calculations. All right. No other questions, then

987
02:04:30.900 --> 02:04:38.190
Brian Nguyen: Over logistics. So you got it for everyone. Everyone has sorry, listen to this presentation, I'm going to send out an email.

988
02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:52.920
Brian Nguyen: a Google form. So give me your kind of time availability. I have some questions and then also kind of ranking the which projects, my interests me the most to work with. Okay, so I'll give you

989
02:04:54.210 --> 02:05:12.150
Brian Nguyen: Five presentations. Please drink them all. Don't use the same don't that don't pick your first, second, third, fourth, fifth all team choices. All right, thank you. I'll send that out and it will Google, you know, five by end up Thursday or Friday every Friday. Okay.

990
02:05:15.090 --> 02:05:20.970
Brian Nguyen: What else. Yeah. So as you know, where we expect everyone to meet with their

991
02:05:22.020 --> 02:05:25.350
Brian Nguyen: Their mentor at least four hours a week. Tell us more.

992
02:05:26.610 --> 02:05:35.100
Brian Nguyen: Or, you know, maybe four hours. It's kind of like four hours is prevalent to putting four hours of work into this. So it's a, you know, bare minimum.

993
02:05:36.450 --> 02:05:38.550
Brian Nguyen: Just, just remember that you get

994
02:05:39.780 --> 02:05:49.410
Brian Nguyen: Whatever you put in. It's whatever you get out of it. Okay, so you put minimal effort. Okay, minimal results out of it. Right. Okay. That seems to know

995
02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:58.230
Brian Nguyen: So that's that. And then also tried to reach out to everyone. I want to share you guys my

996
02:05:59.580 --> 02:06:03.990
Brian Nguyen: Phone number so that you guys can contact me. Right. So I think it's like the easiest

997
02:06:05.340 --> 02:06:07.950
Brian Nguyen: Is just to me a text to say hi to your our

998
02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:15.840
Brian Nguyen: Destiny that number to that number and just kind of like all sometimes there might be something I might be easier to reach out to you.

999
02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:19.290
Brian Nguyen: via text email.
