00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.650
Brian Nguyen: Good morning.

2
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:44.940
Brian Nguyen: Hey,

3
00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.780
Brian Nguyen: So yes, so there is to have me

4
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.800
Brian Nguyen: In case if something happens.

5
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.530
Brian Nguyen: To one of my computers just a backup, just in case. Okay.

6
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:01.560
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, so

7
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.610
Brian Nguyen: Hey, welcome everyone. Good morning. How did you get this weekend.

8
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.560
Brian Nguyen: Good.

9
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:14.100
Brian Nguyen: Alright guys excited

10
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:32.580
Brian Nguyen: All right, I see not judge. Good. Alright so today we can teach you. So today, I'm Brian and this is Jeffrey right there. We're going to be the two people, you're going to be interacting with

11
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:38.640
Brian Nguyen: For the introduction to completion of chemistry and theory.

12
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:40.770
Brian Nguyen: So,

13
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:51.180
Brian Nguyen: Before we get started, I think we will be good to introduce each other, one by one. So one thing I I think I like to do is

14
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:59.880
Brian Nguyen: Introduce yourself where you're from and what is one thing you're looking forward to this summer.

15
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:11.790
Brian Nguyen: Because, you know, I heard that there was a saying that if the happiest people in the world are those who actually the fork is something that has something to look forward to.

16
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:21.900
Brian Nguyen: All right, so I'll get started and then Jeffrey, you'll have introduced himself, and then we'll just go, whoever feel like introducing themselves after that. Okay.

17
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:36.600
Brian Nguyen: All right. My name is Brian. I'm a fourth year fourth year oh one through my I just finished my fourth year of graduate school now and into my sis, we're getting my PhD in theoretical and computational chemistry.

18
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:47.070
Brian Nguyen: One thing that I'm looking forward to this summer is I want to pick up learning the violin, so we'll see. Supposedly, there is a

19
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:57.480
Brian Nguyen: We had to learn it from a young age, or else you can't marry, I know I don't know I heard that. So, oh, I'll try to break that trend will see. Okay.

20
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:01.410
All right.

21
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:07.590
Jeffrey Tsai: I'm Jeffrey, I'm from Massachusetts came over.

22
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.400
Jeffrey Tsai: Like a day or two after today last year.

23
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.000
Jeffrey Tsai: So,

24
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.650
Jeffrey Tsai: What was the stuff we say name or from

25
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:28.230
Brian Nguyen: One thing I just yeah and one to one pointing you're looking forward to this summer.

26
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:42.690
Jeffrey Tsai: I was really busy through the school year, because I have classes and teaching, but over the summer. I don't have any of those. So my biggest time since they're gone, so I'm looking forward to actually getting some stuff done with research.

27
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.220
Aakrsh: Right, we want you

28
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:58.380
Aakrsh: Know minute or two. I'm 15 years old. I'm going to be a junior and a little high school and something I'm looking forward to this summer is just going to the beach.

29
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:08.730
thanh: So I'm talking and I and from palm Valley High School in California and

30
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:19.740
thanh: I'm an incoming senior this year. Something I'm looking forward to doing is just sleeping more because I wasn't able to really sleep over the school year.

31
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:21.210
thanh: Yeah.

32
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:41.160
Theresa Carlos: So I'm curious, so I'm from New Jersey. I'm an incoming senior and I guess one thing I'm looking forward to, I guess, also being able to sleep more. I'm also I'm trying to learn more Korean and try learning guitar as well.

33
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:42.660
Theresa Carlos: Yeah.

34
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:50.340
Brian Nguyen: Mike

35
00:11:54.180 --> 00:12:02.580
Victoria Choi: From California Troy high school and I'm looking forward to golfing more often because I haven't been able to do that.

36
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.820
Brian Nguyen: Is have a comment for curious that I also want to like carry into

37
00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:27.300
Brian Nguyen: A coincidence. Oh, good, good, great. You guys all have something for it to, you know, just the size. Good to have something to look forward to. It keeps you keeps you positive. Keep it moving and all that. Okay, so, um,

38
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.170
Brian Nguyen: Today, just a few logistics stuff.

39
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:43.320
Brian Nguyen: I think we are having a social. I think it's at this Friday afternoon Pacific Coast time and we'll be sending out a Google poll

40
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:54.270
Brian Nguyen: Asking you guys what questions to you has have for former interns and also even for the for us, you know, graduate students during the professor to

41
00:12:54.870 --> 00:13:01.980
Brian Nguyen: I just need some a few questions. You know, they just kind of like it's a very informal, but I just like to get some questions to help with like

42
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:10.590
Brian Nguyen: The activation barrier, you know, to get get this thing started. You know, gets to being from rolling. Alright so today we're just going to be the

43
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:21.480
Brian Nguyen: World will just learn bash commands and if we finished it will continue on and just with turbo mode, too. So it depends on how much you guys get through. All right.

44
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:23.730
Brian Nguyen: So,

45
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.660
Brian Nguyen: This is take this as the baseline.

46
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:32.910
Brian Nguyen: You guys hear that

47
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:41.400
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, let's check out there now. So this week is just a baseline knowledge of things that we think that is

48
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:50.040
Brian Nguyen: Will be needed for you guys. Common skills they need to work with your mentors, the mentors will will all have

49
00:13:51.030 --> 00:14:03.750
Brian Nguyen: Specialized things that you need to be done. So this is kind of just the baseline. All right, you can still offer kind of foundation. Think of that way. Alright. So without further ado let's let the

50
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.940
Brian Nguyen: Let Jeffrey take over. Now, Jeff region we teaching you guys today.

51
00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.030
Brian Nguyen: Introduction bash command.

52
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.790
Brian Nguyen: And so, yeah.

53
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.770
Brian Nguyen: Has had questions before we start.

54
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:26.850
Brian Nguyen: All right, definitely got it.

55
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.340
Jeffrey Tsai: Right. All right.

56
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:31.590
Jeffrey Tsai: So,

57
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.350
Jeffrey Tsai: Does everyone have their terminal open

58
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.320
Jeffrey Tsai: I can. You can actually see everyone

59
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.370
Jeffrey Tsai: So I'll start sharing screen.

60
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.640
Just racing my tracks. Okay.

61
00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:16.590
Jeffrey Tsai: All right, so

62
00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:31.050
Jeffrey Tsai: So our best tutorial is going to cover a few of the things that you're going to need for doing the work in the lab. It's all like rudimentary stuff. So once you

63
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.540
Jeffrey Tsai: Have it committed to memory.

64
00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:40.650
Jeffrey Tsai: Everything should just come pretty naturally

65
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.770
Jeffrey Tsai: So once you've opened up your terminal.

66
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:46.500
Jeffrey Tsai: So you should see

67
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.140
Jeffrey Tsai: This tilda here.

68
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:54.690
Jeffrey Tsai: To tell you that you are currently in your home directory

69
00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:01.980
Jeffrey Tsai: So in usual file systems like Windows and Max.

70
00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:15.150
Jeffrey Tsai: This tilda directory would just be the first directory you see when you open up like either my documents know my computer or

71
00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.990
Jeffrey Tsai: Or as a finder for Mac don't use Mac. So, yeah.

72
00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.380
Jeffrey Tsai: Right. So once you've opened it up.

73
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:31.560
Jeffrey Tsai: So this directory, the to the home directory is not

74
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:38.520
Jeffrey Tsai: The highest level of the directories. So the directory. Start at the root.

75
00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:52.170
Jeffrey Tsai: And then it branches off into separate directories. So the first thing we can do is we can just type ls so Alice I think stands for list.

76
00:16:53.220 --> 00:17:00.330
Jeffrey Tsai: And if you press Enter, it shows all the directories that are currently or files that are currently in the folder that you're in.

77
00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:06.840
Jeffrey Tsai: And you'll see the usual suspects like desktop documents downloads and so on.

78
00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:10.290
Jeffrey Tsai: Now if you want to see.

79
00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:16.650
Jeffrey Tsai: Where we're currently at starting from the group and down we can

80
00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.080
Jeffrey Tsai: Type in PWD

81
00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:30.690
Jeffrey Tsai: And from here we can see that from the route which is starting from the left where in the folder home and then within that we're in the folder.

82
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.560
Jeffrey Tsai: Should be your username at this point.

83
00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:37.230
Right.

84
00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:45.240
Jeffrey Tsai: And so now we can just go to the root. So just CD slash

85
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.290
Jeffrey Tsai: And now you'll see that if you LS

86
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:56.730
Jeffrey Tsai: You know, see separate list of all the most important

87
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.810
Jeffrey Tsai: Directories within the Unix file system.

88
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.260
Jeffrey Tsai: So there's things like the boot.

89
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.050
Jeffrey Tsai: Boot files.

90
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:11.400
Jeffrey Tsai: If you delete these boot files, then your computer becomes useless.

91
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.060
Jeffrey Tsai: These are the actual files for you to

92
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:18.570
Jeffrey Tsai: Be able to have your computer, turn on.

93
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:25.320
Jeffrey Tsai: From the PWD that we did, we see that we were in the home. So we have this home directory here.

94
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.230
Jeffrey Tsai: And there's some other ones.

95
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:42.300
Jeffrey Tsai: That probably won't be using much the Ben is for binaries. So that's where your typical like executive roles. So the axes would be

96
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:44.520
Okay.

97
00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.800
Jeffrey Tsai: Brian. Are there any other directories that you think

98
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:52.470
Jeffrey Tsai: Are really important

99
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:59.460
Brian Nguyen: Go for now guys having you have questions, he goes

100
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:04.260
Brian Nguyen: I know that in Windows and Mac. So let me get great well

101
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.720
Jeffrey Tsai: You might not see as many of these

102
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:15.030
Jeffrey Tsai: directories that are based on the Windows Ubuntu system.

103
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:26.700
Brian Nguyen: Just follow along and just kind of, you know, practice. Right. Right. Okay. So, there's no question. Let's move on. Right. You feel free to stop this.

104
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.140
Good.

105
00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:33.000
Alright.

106
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:44.190
Jeffrey Tsai: So we'll get back to this home directory. There's two ways that we can do this. We can either CD change directory to just the tilda again.

107
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:54.600
Jeffrey Tsai: For we can also just directly write out the path that we had for so just slash home slash and then your username.

108
00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.420
Jeffrey Tsai: Now pls, we can see that we're back in the same place that we were before.

109
00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.470
Jeffrey Tsai: OK, so now

110
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.840
See

111
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:18.900
Jeffrey Tsai: So that will try and making our own directories. So I've already done it here, but we can

112
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.420
Jeffrey Tsai: All remove the directory to

113
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:32.010
Jeffrey Tsai: Okay, so in order to make a directory. So you'll type in MK dir from make direct directory

114
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:34.260
Jeffrey Tsai: And then

115
00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:44.730
Jeffrey Tsai: We'll just make two directories. So the first one I made was directory one. So, first make directory one and then I felt make directory to

116
00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:50.640
Jeffrey Tsai: And once we've made this directory. If we Alice again.

117
00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:55.950
Jeffrey Tsai: Will see that the directory that we just made is now listed in blue.

118
00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:01.320
Jeffrey Tsai: And

119
00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:07.800
Jeffrey Tsai: If we want to make a file instead. So instead of make their

120
00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:15.600
Jeffrey Tsai: Will use the command touch so on nameless file three because I already have files.

121
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:18.180
Zero into on here.

122
00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:23.700
Jeffrey Tsai: So once we touch, we can see that the files also popped up in white.

123
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:38.190
Jeffrey Tsai: And if we want to input some text into one of the files. There's also two ways of doing this. There's if you're familiar with the, I think it's Java that uses print off.

124
00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:40.980
As well as C plus plus.

125
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.600
Jeffrey Tsai: So we have print off. And then we also have ECHO.

126
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.230
Jeffrey Tsai: So if we type in ago

127
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:59.850
Jeffrey Tsai: We can input a string into the file. So to have it be a string will use the apostrophe.

128
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:04.710
Jeffrey Tsai: And because this comes I will use hello world.

129
00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:13.020
Jeffrey Tsai: And then in order to input into the specific file will have this

130
00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.700
Jeffrey Tsai: Less than sign going into file three

131
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:26.700
Jeffrey Tsai: So now echo should have put the words hello world into file three. So in order to check that.

132
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:41.250
Jeffrey Tsai: Instead of CD, which we use to go into a directory. We can use cat stands for concatenate there's another use for which is concatenate files but also works for just seeing what the file looks like.

133
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.770
Jeffrey Tsai: So if we kept file three

134
00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.310
Jeffrey Tsai: Will see the text that's inside

135
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:50.640
Alright.

136
00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:57.180
Brian Nguyen: Jeffrey. Can you explain what the string of. Not a lot of people don't know.

137
00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:03.180
Jeffrey Tsai: Okay, so in computer science. There are

138
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:11.550
Jeffrey Tsai: Different data types that you can have. So everything is a string of zeros and ones, but

139
00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:16.170
Jeffrey Tsai: Some smart people in the past, decided to

140
00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.060
Jeffrey Tsai: Specifically to find certain

141
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:30.750
Jeffrey Tsai: ways of storing data. So one of them would be integers. So just our regular integer numbers.

142
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:37.830
Jeffrey Tsai: Strings, which is a list of characters so

143
00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.110
Jeffrey Tsai: This would be a string.

144
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:47.100
Jeffrey Tsai: There's also characters, which is just a single character.

145
00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:51.600
Jeffrey Tsai: Whereas the string as a string of characters and then

146
00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:55.800
Jeffrey Tsai: It depends on the

147
00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:58.770
Jeffrey Tsai: Coding that you use, but

148
00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:06.960
Jeffrey Tsai: Other than integers. You also have doubles, which is a double position number several decimals.

149
00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.330
Jeffrey Tsai: Floats

150
00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.010
Jeffrey Tsai: And C.

151
00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:20.790
Jeffrey Tsai: And then another common one would be billions. So bullying is just true and false

152
00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:25.710
Jeffrey Tsai: That's usually started as heroes zero or one.

153
00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.490
Jeffrey Tsai: So whenever you do any

154
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:40.560
Jeffrey Tsai: Any coding in our the store and the data you always wanted. You'll always end up using

155
00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.580
Jeffrey Tsai: At least one of the data type scenario to store the data.

156
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:53.310
Brian Nguyen: That question.

157
00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:08.760
Jeffrey Tsai: Alright, so

158
00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:22.020
Jeffrey Tsai: CD. So another command that is helpful for us would be copy. So CP

159
00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.370
Jeffrey Tsai: So if we can be. And then we can copy file three

160
00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:38.820
Jeffrey Tsai: So the way that copy works as you put in copy the file that you want to copy and then the destination that you want to copy that file to

161
00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:40.980
Jeffrey Tsai: So,

162
00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:45.660
Jeffrey Tsai: Instead of other than just directly

163
00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:59.160
Jeffrey Tsai: Stating which directory that he wants to copy it to if you're in the current directory that you want to copy it to the current directory is also represented by a period.

164
00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:04.920
Jeffrey Tsai: So if I wanted to copy file three to the current directory

165
00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.800
Jeffrey Tsai: As a file called file for

166
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:12.300
Jeffrey Tsai: If we all this again.

167
00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:24.510
Jeffrey Tsai: Will see that the file for is on here. Now, actually, can everyone see the full terminal because migraine blog boxes like only in the corner.

168
00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:31.320
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, I think I could see it. I can you make the text bigger, Control Shift plus

169
00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:38.970
Jeffrey Tsai: Maybe

170
00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:43.320
Jeffrey Tsai: You want to make the text bigger in the terminal, Control Shift plus. And then if you want to

171
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.020
Jeffrey Tsai: Control minus

172
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.760
Brian Nguyen: On a Mac, but he's command.

173
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.100
Okay, yeah.

174
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:06.150
Jeffrey Tsai: Alright, so we made the two directories. So made directory one directory to so

175
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.470
Jeffrey Tsai: We can say bye to directory tail.

176
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:18.330
Jeffrey Tsai: So in order to take away the directory will just use room are under for removed directory

177
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.490
Jeffrey Tsai: And we'll see that's the spirit down

178
00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:42.960
Jeffrey Tsai: So now let's try copying file over files onto our directory one. So I've already put one file in there, but we'll just put in the new files so we can again do CP

179
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.330
Jeffrey Tsai: The name of the file.

180
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:49.770
Jeffrey Tsai: And now we can just say,

181
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.940
Jeffrey Tsai: Copy this into directory one

182
00:27:55.290 --> 00:28:00.810
Jeffrey Tsai: And if we want to name it something else we can always name it something else. So I'll just call it file five

183
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.030
Jeffrey Tsai: And then if we go into directory one

184
00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.450
Jeffrey Tsai: So will change directory into directory one

185
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:17.310
Jeffrey Tsai: Will see that file five has now been added into this directory

186
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.540
Jeffrey Tsai: Okay, so

187
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:38.880
Jeffrey Tsai: Well, now go back to the home directory. So whereas period just a period is the current directory. If you want to change to the directory above this one. It's just two periods.

188
00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:45.210
Jeffrey Tsai: So now we'll see that instead of directory one. We're back in the Tilda.

189
00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:46.890
Home directory

190
00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:56.940
Jeffrey Tsai: Alright, so for a directory to we were able to just remove it with removed her

191
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.780
Jeffrey Tsai: But if we now try it with directory one

192
00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:07.710
Jeffrey Tsai: Will see that because the directory is not empty, we have file five in there.

193
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:24.090
Jeffrey Tsai: We can't remove it. So if you want to remove the files within the directory like all the files within the directory. So instead of removed or in order to just remove a file will just use RM, for Remove

194
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:32.880
Jeffrey Tsai: And if we want to remove every single file from directory one will say directory one slash star.

195
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:49.320
Jeffrey Tsai: So with star, you have to be careful because it deletes everything within the directory. So there's our stories of like research groups where someone goes into the root directory and then besides the looking delete everything with a certain command.

196
00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.470
Jeffrey Tsai: And that is

197
00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.510
Jeffrey Tsai: Think why my professor said he knows haunted did that before.

198
00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:03.120
Jeffrey Tsai: So just be careful of that. So if we remove everything within director one

199
00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:08.850
Jeffrey Tsai: And I'll just go in to confirm that everything's empty so director glances empty.

200
00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.850
Jeffrey Tsai: We cannot remove vector

201
00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:33.780
Brian Nguyen: File swap

202
00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.610
Jeffrey Tsai: Well, I was just testing it out earlier.

203
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:46.020
Jeffrey Tsai: testing out the plan earlier and I think I created a hidden file.

204
00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:58.320
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so I'll add a little bit today. So if you guys make a file in it for several some reason your gym.

205
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:11.040
Brian Nguyen: Crashes you'll have some backup file called file swap so you can kind of copy that file as your backup. Okay.

206
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.440
Brian Nguyen: guys have questions here.

207
00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:22.440
Brian Nguyen: All right, good. Any three guys able to create the directories copy is NOT GO AHEAD, SAY YES OR thumbs up

208
00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:28.350
Brian Nguyen: Though this kind of basic so we'll start getting a little bit harder and you're exactly

209
00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:30.240
Brian Nguyen: Right.

210
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:33.900
doesn't get too hard.

211
00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:35.580
Jeffrey Tsai: Because like

212
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.250
Jeffrey Tsai: The thing about UNIX is

213
00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:44.310
Jeffrey Tsai: Everything is really, really well documented. So if you ever have to reference something

214
00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:50.100
Jeffrey Tsai: There's plenty of websites with like cheat sheets on all the commands that you could possibly want.

215
00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:53.700
Jeffrey Tsai: If you ever want to check like

216
00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:56.910
Jeffrey Tsai: The options that you can use for

217
00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.650
Jeffrey Tsai: A for a command, you can just do man for manual

218
00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:08.130
Jeffrey Tsai: And you'll just see all the different options listed here for what you can do.

219
00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.110
Jeffrey Tsai: So you'll notice that there's a dash before letter.

220
00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:20.070
Jeffrey Tsai: So it's the same thing I did here. This LS dash a

221
00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:24.690
Jeffrey Tsai: Will show me the hidden files or directories within a folder.

222
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:29.250
Okay.

223
00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:34.890
Jeffrey Tsai: So just to clear the screen, you can just type in clear and then

224
00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.580
Jeffrey Tsai: It doesn't. So I think on a

225
00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:55.680
Jeffrey Tsai: At least on the Windows Subsystem I think that when you do clear the text everything that you did before should probably still be there and then you would be able to scroll up and see it again so clear, which is like, move your screen down

226
00:32:57.810 --> 00:32:58.530
Jeffrey Tsai: Right, so

227
00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:06.570
Jeffrey Tsai: There are two main file editors that you'll run into at least in this loud so there's Vim.

228
00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:08.460
Jeffrey Tsai: Or VI.

229
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:14.910
Jeffrey Tsai: Thing for them is the near version of VI. But both of them open the same

230
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:25.470
Jeffrey Tsai: Open the same software or you can use Emacs, which is Brian's in Professor forces preferred file editor.

231
00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:33.030
Jeffrey Tsai: But in this case Vim is just within this terminal. It doesn't open up a new

232
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:39.210
Jeffrey Tsai: A new window. So a lot of people enough preferring them.

233
00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:47.370
Jeffrey Tsai: Right, so I'm just going to remove all these files and I will create a new file to

234
00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:50.880
Jeffrey Tsai: Use film on

235
00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:56.820
Jeffrey Tsai: So if you need to remove files, you can always just

236
00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:04.020
Jeffrey Tsai: You can always just list them out right after the remove command and all of them will be removed.

237
00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:07.530
Jeffrey Tsai: Okay, so if we

238
00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:11.820
Jeffrey Tsai: It's good practice to just make the file first before

239
00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.110
Jeffrey Tsai: Using them on it. So I'll create a new file.

240
00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:17.790
Jeffrey Tsai: And then

241
00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:24.300
Jeffrey Tsai: I'll do VI file. So now we're inside them.

242
00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:29.400
Jeffrey Tsai: So because we just created the file, it's going to be empty.

243
00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:32.460
Jeffrey Tsai: So if we want to insert

244
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.710
Jeffrey Tsai: Something

245
00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:39.720
Jeffrey Tsai: Into here will press. So right now we're at the

246
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:42.300
Jeffrey Tsai: stage where

247
00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:55.650
Jeffrey Tsai: Where we're in like a command stage. So we can't actually just directly type whatever we want in here because will activate commands based on whatever letters, the typing.

248
00:34:56.670 --> 00:35:00.120
Jeffrey Tsai: So in order to insert new text we had to press I

249
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:01.860
Jeffrey Tsai: For insert

250
00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:05.100
Jeffrey Tsai: And then we'll be able to

251
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:06.810
Type

252
00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:08.880
In here.

253
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:14.490
Jeffrey Tsai: So if you want to do anything else.

254
00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:21.540
Jeffrey Tsai: Well, actually, well, we'll do more than one line. So hello world.

255
00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:23.970
Jeffrey Tsai: And then let's say

256
00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.880
Jeffrey Tsai: High School outreach program.

257
00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:29.220
You can type whatever you want here.

258
00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.160
Jeffrey Tsai: Now to get out of this insert mode.

259
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:38.820
Jeffrey Tsai: You can just press escape so escape through

260
00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:44.280
Jeffrey Tsai: escape through the insert mode.

261
00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:51.300
Jeffrey Tsai: For some reason, when I type on this computer. If I use the up, down, left, right, arrows.

262
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:57.540
Jeffrey Tsai: In insert that makes a letter.

263
00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:03.060
Jeffrey Tsai: But besides the arrow keys to navigate

264
00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:10.170
Jeffrey Tsai: You can also use H, I, J, K, and L. So he would be left

265
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:12.390
Jeffrey Tsai: J won't be

266
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.140
Jeffrey Tsai: Jay, would be down okay is up.

267
00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:17.970
Jeffrey Tsai: And an L.

268
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.420
Oh,

269
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:23.370
Jeffrey Tsai: And Alice right

270
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:30.660
Right.

271
00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:35.760
So I'm just going to click this

272
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:40.560
Jeffrey Tsai: So if we wanted to lead lines.

273
00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:47.040
Jeffrey Tsai: It's the command DD, so if we just type in DD

274
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:50.430
Jeffrey Tsai: Then will delete that line that we're on

275
00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:56.670
Jeffrey Tsai: And if we want to paste that line somewhere else. We can just press P

276
00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:01.980
Jeffrey Tsai: So P is going to paste it below the line that you're currently on

277
00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:11.280
Jeffrey Tsai: And if instead of deleting the line. We want to just copy it, we can just press why why

278
00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:19.440
Jeffrey Tsai: So instead of DVD. It's why, why, and then we'll press play again and I'll just paste the line again.

279
00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:24.900
See

280
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:27.810
Jeffrey Tsai: So the main other

281
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.960
Jeffrey Tsai: Commands would be

282
00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:40.050
Jeffrey Tsai: Something like slash so you'll see at the bottom of the screen a slash turned up.

283
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:42.990
Jeffrey Tsai: So if we want to look for

284
00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:45.090
Jeffrey Tsai: A certain word

285
00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:51.750
Jeffrey Tsai: We can just type it in. Press Enter. And they'll bring us to the first instance of the word.

286
00:37:53.340 --> 00:38:00.240
Jeffrey Tsai: After wherever we were before. So if we're on the first line and we do the school.

287
00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:02.640
Jeffrey Tsai: Will bring us to the first school

288
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:13.980
Jeffrey Tsai: Now for down here and we want to search upwards. So instead of going down research upwards, we can use question mark.

289
00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:17.190
Jeffrey Tsai: And I'll bring us up to whatever word

290
00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:24.810
Jeffrey Tsai: And if a file happens to be longer.

291
00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:30.420
Jeffrey Tsai: There's two ways that you can navigate to the top and bottom. So

292
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.590
Jeffrey Tsai: If we want to navigate to the bottom of the file.

293
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:47.220
Jeffrey Tsai: Will do capital G. So, shift g will bring us to the last line of file. And if we want to return to the top of the file, it's just lowercase G. G.

294
00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:55.260
Jeffrey Tsai: And other than that.

295
00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.100
Jeffrey Tsai: I don't think you'll end up using

296
00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.800
Jeffrey Tsai: Other options.

297
00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:06.450
Jeffrey Tsai: So there's several different ways of quitting activists program.

298
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:11.760
Jeffrey Tsai: So if you want to save and quit. You'll type in colon.

299
00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:13.530
Jeffrey Tsai: W. Q.

300
00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:15.510
Jeffrey Tsai: And they'll save and quit.

301
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:33.390
Jeffrey Tsai: My preferred method is just capital ZZ so just Shift Z and the difference between Tim is calling who will save the file and then quit out of it while shifts easy will

302
00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:39.060
Jeffrey Tsai: Quit other file and I'll save it. If you ended up actually making changes.

303
00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:44.940
Jeffrey Tsai: So if you just don't make any changes just keeps the finalizes

304
00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.340
Jeffrey Tsai: Alright, so we'll just move on to

305
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.990
Jeffrey Tsai: Scripting

306
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.870
Jeffrey Tsai: So let's see.

307
00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:11.880
Jeffrey Tsai: I'm just going to do this in the documents folder instead. So I'll just see it into documents.

308
00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:25.710
Jeffrey Tsai: Oh, don't go over this command yet. So if you want to move a file and still copy it. It's just empty.

309
00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:28.740
Let's move on to research.

310
00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:39.600
Jeffrey Tsai: So bass scripting is a way of just making a

311
00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:44.760
Jeffrey Tsai: An executive all file. So if we want to create

312
00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:50.130
Jeffrey Tsai: A basket. We can do something like touch.

313
00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:53.220
Let's just caught script.

314
00:40:56.490 --> 00:41:00.150
Jeffrey Tsai: And all them into it to start the script.

315
00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:14.940
Brian Nguyen: Hey guys. Just a question.

316
00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:17.850
Brian Nguyen: Is everyone following all this

317
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:43.290
Jeffrey Tsai: Brian, do you need to have the shell extension on the file name for you make the scripts or is it

318
00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:49.650
Brian Nguyen: No, I think it should be fine. But if you want it depends.

319
00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:51.570
Brian Nguyen: If you just

320
00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:54.510
Do it, just in case. And usually

321
00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:09.660
Jeffrey Tsai: So I'll remove rename the file that I made. So if you want to rename it's just move again.

322
00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:15.540
Jeffrey Tsai: So that sh is for shell.

323
00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:32.730
Jeffrey Tsai: So when it comes to Unix there's several different flavors of Unix. So there's different ways there's there's different sets of ways that you can invoke Unix code. So one of them is the

324
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:35.010
Bash scripting.

325
00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:41.250
Jeffrey Tsai: Right, so we'll film on to the script SH again.

326
00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:51.090
Jeffrey Tsai: And if you want to write a basket. It always starts with the shipping. So it's just

327
00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.910
Jeffrey Tsai: Pound exclamation mark.

328
00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:57.840
Jeffrey Tsai: And then we'll have slash

329
00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:02.610
Jeffrey Tsai: Then for binary and then slash bash

330
00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:04.680
Jeffrey Tsai: Bash scripting.

331
00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:13.020
Jeffrey Tsai: So instead of echoing a line into the file.

332
00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:15.570
Jeffrey Tsai: We can just have

333
00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:22.380
Jeffrey Tsai: A line of code into the command line. So if we do go, Hello World.

334
00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:27.840
Jeffrey Tsai: Then if we can turn the

335
00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:31.260
Jeffrey Tsai: This file into an executable, and then run it.

336
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:34.470
Jeffrey Tsai: It will execute any command.

337
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:42.180
Jeffrey Tsai: will execute any command that is within here.

338
00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:48.480
Jeffrey Tsai: So the main use that you'll probably end up having with us is if you have to rerun

339
00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:51.690
Jeffrey Tsai: Certain calculations.

340
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:59.970
Jeffrey Tsai: There are different programs that you'll have to use within our software terrible and

341
00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:10.230
Jeffrey Tsai: If you want to make the process quicker you can always write a script in order to just do the repeated thing for you.

342
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:16.140
Jeffrey Tsai: So there's a program called define. So if we wanted to just

343
00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:27.930
Jeffrey Tsai: Use the fine in the same way for different calculations, if we just write the basket to go through the defined by itself, then if we run it will work for

344
00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.340
Jeffrey Tsai: All those different calculate all those calculations.

345
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:45.180
Jeffrey Tsai: Right. So we've made the file. So we can exit out of it.

346
00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:49.650
Jeffrey Tsai: With either colon W Q or capitals easy

347
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:59.940
Jeffrey Tsai: Now, if we allow us will see that the script is still in white. So it's still just the regular text file.

348
00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:08.700
Jeffrey Tsai: So now we want to turn it into a an executive file. So if we want to do that.

349
00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:21.450
Jeffrey Tsai: You can always look this up later. Again, there's more than one way of doing this, but if you do CH mod you plus x, and I wish every file that you want to turn into a script.

350
00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:28.500
Jeffrey Tsai: Will see that now the white has turned into green

351
00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:33.180
Jeffrey Tsai: And if we want to run this file.

352
00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:35.280
Jeffrey Tsai: Should be

353
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:40.140
Jeffrey Tsai: So dot for the period for the current directory

354
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:43.560
Jeffrey Tsai: And then the name of the executive will

355
00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:48.180
Jeffrey Tsai: And it will run the executive role for you.

356
00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.560
Actually can't see everyone for some reason.

357
00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:17.730
Jeffrey Tsai: If you want to have a process repeated there's

358
00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.020
Jeffrey Tsai: Something called a for loop. So if you've taken

359
00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:29.820
Jeffrey Tsai: A class, then you've definitely work with for loops. So there's different loops that you can use for while

360
00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:34.770
As well as if there's one more.

361
00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:38.010
Jeffrey Tsai: So what a for loop will do

362
00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:41.670
Jeffrey Tsai: Is you tell the for loop.

363
00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:51.840
Jeffrey Tsai: How many times to run something and it'll run it. However, many times that you need. So let's make a

364
00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.520
Jeffrey Tsai: Just call it for loop.

365
00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:02.820
Jeffrey Tsai: So we'll make a new file to make a for loop in and then run that so

366
00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:06.510
Jeffrey Tsai: Well, if I enter

367
00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:14.820
Jeffrey Tsai: So again, for the executive or start with the surveying and been slashed batch.

368
00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:21.720
Jeffrey Tsai: So I have to run for an artist, writer for loop.

369
00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:23.640
Jeffrey Tsai: You start with for

370
00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.940
Jeffrey Tsai: And now.

371
00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:47.460
Jeffrey Tsai: You'll have to define a variable. So this variable is going to cycle through different values. So if you give it values one through six, then every time you run the for loop, they'll start at one and then once you run it will turn into two until you get to six.

372
00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:52.260
Jeffrey Tsai: So typically for this kind of counting

373
00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.070
Jeffrey Tsai: The variable name will just be I

374
00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:04.980
Jeffrey Tsai: And if we want to define a range of values over which you can

375
00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:06.870
Jeffrey Tsai: Run this

376
00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.110
Jeffrey Tsai: You'll want to use the curly bracket.

377
00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:12.960
Jeffrey Tsai: The number that you want to start on

378
00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:18.570
Jeffrey Tsai: And then in ellipses dot dot

379
00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:21.300
Jeffrey Tsai: And then whichever know where you want to stop on

380
00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.420
Jeffrey Tsai: And then close curly bracket.

381
00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:29.160
Okay, I'm hoping the town for okay

382
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:38.550
Jeffrey Tsai: So whenever you make a for loop, whatever you want to run is going to be inside it and

383
00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:49.260
Jeffrey Tsai: Instead of staying on the same line you'll want to have an indent. So the way that I'm used to is just having it. But the way that

384
00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:57.420
Jeffrey Tsai: People writing code for terrible like to use is the intention of just three spaces.

385
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:05.310
Jeffrey Tsai: OK, so now will vary. What we want to run with them as far

386
00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:09.930
Jeffrey Tsai: So we'll just do the same thing for just echo hello world.

387
00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:15.360
Jeffrey Tsai: Sorry, sorry.

388
00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:28.680
Jeffrey Tsai: Sorry, I'm not used to the navigating with H I J K L.

389
00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.540
Jeffrey Tsai: So before you write what you want to run. You'll have to do

390
00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:41.430
Jeffrey Tsai: Do

391
00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:50.550
Jeffrey Tsai: And then you write whatever you want to run

392
00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:57.450
Jeffrey Tsai: And then whenever you know once you're done with whatever it needs to be run

393
00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:01.830
Jeffrey Tsai: He'll just type in done and I'll and for loop.

394
00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:07.890
Jeffrey Tsai: Okay, so now press Escape to get off the insert mode.

395
00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:11.820
Jeffrey Tsai: And then press capitals, easy to get out the

396
00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:14.700
Film program.

397
00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:23.400
Jeffrey Tsai: So I'll do the same thing to turn the for loop file into the executive so CH, but people sex.

398
00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:25.920
Jeffrey Tsai: For loop.

399
00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:33.300
Jeffrey Tsai: And running it.

400
00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.900
Jeffrey Tsai: Will just do period such for loop.

401
00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:57.510
Brian Nguyen: Wow, so

402
00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:02.970
Brian Nguyen: This is a very teachable moment for everyone so

403
00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:16.770
Brian Nguyen: So when you have a problem. He has some issues very first thing you process through try to understand what just happened. So the first step is to look at your script.

404
00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:19.980
So looking at the

405
00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:26.550
Same way,

406
00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:29.370
Brian Nguyen: Say you say echo world.

407
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:32.700
Brian Nguyen: Agenda five times.

408
00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.970
Brian Nguyen: Think spaces manner, but in that

409
00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:03.930
Jeffrey Tsai: Way.

410
00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:15.360
Jeffrey Tsai: If I run into trouble. And I need you know the answers and feel free to speak up.

411
00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:23.970
Brian Nguyen: I stopped the air guy. I'm here.

412
00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:40.080
Brian Nguyen: Okay, the air is so on your third line for i in curly brace one created five is supposed to be two periods, not

413
00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:42.510
Jeffrey Tsai: Okay.

414
00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:44.610
My dad.

415
00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:46.890
Brian Nguyen: Had a take home.

416
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:50.850
Jeffrey Tsai: I was the one who wrote that so

417
00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:52.320
Yeah.

418
00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:57.750
Jeffrey Tsai: Teachable Moment, make sure that you type things, and probably

419
00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:04.290
Jeffrey Tsai: Other thing that

420
00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:06.360
Jeffrey Tsai: Try it again.

421
00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:20.820
Brian Nguyen: Alright guys,

422
00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:27.630
Brian Nguyen: Whenever first learning. This was a little confusing for me. Are you guys are following this

423
00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:32.010
Brian Nguyen: Give me a nice

424
00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:34.230
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

425
00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:39.600
Jeffrey Tsai: So let me know. I'm going to slow

426
00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:50.100
Brian Nguyen: Ah syntax error. Okay.

427
00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:59.280
Brian Nguyen: We can do is, can you share your screen and then I think everyone here can take a look at your script and see what happens.

428
00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:06.600
Brian Nguyen: Okay, can I contribute to the discussion I want this to be as interactive as possible.

429
00:54:18.690 --> 00:54:21.690
Brian Nguyen: All right, you have a syntax error.

430
00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:32.100
Brian Nguyen: Okay, let's look at the for loop structure and I'm going to open this up to the floor for the high school students. Yes, you can.

431
00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:34.770
Brian Nguyen: Do you have a swap

432
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:37.380
Brian Nguyen: A report.

433
00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:41.040
Brian Nguyen: I do LS

434
00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:49.740
Brian Nguyen: Do LS space dash l

435
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:54.270
Brian Nguyen: Did I give you a little bit more information.

436
00:54:55.380 --> 00:55:00.390
Brian Nguyen: About yours. Oh, OK. Sorry LS dash a

437
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:03.300
Brian Nguyen: Safe Space

438
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.170
Brian Nguyen: In

439
00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:17.880
Brian Nguyen: There we go. Okay, you have that. So, something happened. I guess it created a backup file.

440
00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:28.410
Brian Nguyen: So what we can do is just look at that backup file so VI saves for you swap

441
00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:33.090
Brian Nguyen: Period.

442
00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:36.300
Brian Nguyen: For swap

443
00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:39.720
See what's in there.

444
00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:45.750
Brian Nguyen: So it's just a bunch of binary. Okay, let's get out quick

445
00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:56.370
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so we can just remove that file.

446
00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:58.950
Brian Nguyen: You remove it.

447
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:13.170
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so now let's look at your for the script now and then, I think I know the air. I see the air already

448
00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:16.440
Brian Nguyen: See if anyone else can spot it.

449
00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:23.880
Brian Nguyen: Without Nokia Nokia so reducing the form the file for you.

450
00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:26.550
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

451
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:30.630
Brian Nguyen: Alright guys,

452
00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.590
Brian Nguyen: Creation time Victoria.

453
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:42.690
Been up

454
00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:44.610
Jeffrey Tsai: No problem.

455
00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:52.380
Brian Nguyen: No. Are you having problems for that on your Mac or no.

456
00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:54.960
Brian Nguyen: Me. Yeah, no.

457
00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:58.920
Brian Nguyen: No. Okay. All right. Well, see, I see anyone else.

458
00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:06.660
Victoria Choi: So there's no space between the end and

459
00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:11.040
Brian Nguyen: That's great. That's great.

460
00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:19.260
Brian Nguyen: I think you have up here keys. I don't think the math, the math works that way.

461
00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:27.900
Brian Nguyen: Yep. So it's pretty much like you know you'll, you'll find it's very is a very common error, all we have some space, this issue.

462
00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:32.910
Brian Nguyen: Oh, will happen.

463
00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:37.710
Brian Nguyen: Right, do you escape, escape.

464
00:57:39.570 --> 00:57:40.380
Brian Nguyen: Press colon.

465
00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:43.410
Brian Nguyen: You

466
00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:46.950
Brian Nguyen: And you said, press Enter.

467
00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:51.600
Brian Nguyen: And press colon you again.

468
00:57:57.390 --> 00:58:01.980
Brian Nguyen: Very good. Okay, so if you want to edit the file. Remember interpret

469
00:58:08.850 --> 00:58:11.070
Brian Nguyen: The arrow key, can you do now.

470
00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:19.800
Brian Nguyen: Okay. All right.

471
00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:23.580
Brian Nguyen: Escape say that in the script.

472
00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:40.110
Brian Nguyen: All right, here we go.

473
00:58:41.130 --> 00:58:45.480
Brian Nguyen: How you troubleshoot to oftentimes kind of really silly errors.

474
00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:53.820
Brian Nguyen: Yeah.

475
00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:59.460
Jeffrey Tsai: So we'll work with a couple more.

476
00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:05.280
Jeffrey Tsai: functionalities.

477
00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:14.400
Jeffrey Tsai: So we'll be reading another For Loop. So we'll just create a new file was caught for loop to

478
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:16.830
Jeffrey Tsai: And I will go in

479
00:59:20.070 --> 00:59:22.380
Jeffrey Tsai: So again, we'll start with the shoe bang.

480
00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:28.830
Jeffrey Tsai: And we'll be making a for loop again so

481
00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:34.440
Jeffrey Tsai: Brian this for live is a great idea.

482
00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:40.200
Jeffrey Tsai: Right, so we'll just

483
00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:44.100
Jeffrey Tsai: Run the for the over i equals one through five again.

484
00:59:44.790 --> 00:59:46.440
Brian Nguyen: carefree maybe we want to

485
00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:53.010
Brian Nguyen: Let the students create this for yourself that's given a task. Right.

486
00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:59.190
Jeffrey Tsai: There's a couple functionalities that we didn't go over yet though.

487
01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:07.470
Jeffrey Tsai: Reference to

488
01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:10.020
Jeffrey Tsai: Teacher, I

489
01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.380
Jeffrey Tsai: As well as echoing

490
01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:15.660
Jeffrey Tsai: Echoing a

491
01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:28.170
Alright.

492
01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:30.120
Brian Nguyen: That's fine.

493
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:35.490
Jeffrey Tsai: I'll just like look it up on their own.

494
01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:42.540
Jeffrey Tsai: If you ever need to refer to

495
01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:47.070
Jeffrey Tsai: A variable for the for loop.

496
01:00:49.470 --> 01:01:00.450
Jeffrey Tsai: It's going to be dollar sign I so whenever you write dollar, said I, it will use whichever number that is on. So if I said

497
01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:06.090
Jeffrey Tsai: So if I wanted to, like,

498
01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:13.530
Jeffrey Tsai: Write the number one within the file. We could just do a go.

499
01:01:16.770 --> 01:01:18.180
Jeffrey Tsai: Into a file.

500
01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:22.140
Jeffrey Tsai: Right, so the exercise here.

501
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:26.670
Jeffrey Tsai: Will be to write a for loop.

502
01:01:27.930 --> 01:01:35.760
Jeffrey Tsai: Where you will create directories that are called 1234 and five.

503
01:01:38.850 --> 01:01:40.650
Jeffrey Tsai: You'll go into the directory

504
01:01:44.850 --> 01:01:50.340
Jeffrey Tsai: And then you will write the past to that directory into a file.

505
01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:56.370
Jeffrey Tsai: Called destination text.

506
01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.700
Jeffrey Tsai: So the way that you can

507
01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.760
Jeffrey Tsai: I go a path would be ECHO.

508
01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:10.860
Jeffrey Tsai: And then

509
01:02:13.110 --> 01:02:22.290
Jeffrey Tsai: The dollar sign is again for referring to something. So what we're referring to would be the path to the directory so PWD

510
01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:26.130
Okay.

511
01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.950
Jeffrey Tsai: So Trinity is here. Okay.

512
01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:38.460
Jeffrey Tsai: Okay, so let's see.

513
01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.790
Jeffrey Tsai: So write that out on to

514
01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:45.150
Good.

515
01:02:46.410 --> 01:02:48.600
Jeffrey Tsai: Chat. If I can see the chat.

516
01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:00.090
Brian Nguyen: I draw illustration. And we use that whiteboard, you can

517
01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:05.760
Brian Nguyen: Ray techs in the box. Okay. All right, guys.

518
01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:14.460
Brian Nguyen: All right, so I love me, I'm a visual learner. I like to see pictures. Maybe this will help you a little bit. Alright.

519
01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.340
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so

520
01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:31.980
Brian Nguyen: Alright, great.

521
01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:33.480
Brian Nguyen: So,

522
01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:36.720
Brian Nguyen: You guys just want to

523
01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:41.220
Brian Nguyen: Make sure you guys understand what for loops are

524
01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:46.470
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so what. So when you're trying to

525
01:03:47.550 --> 01:04:04.680
Brian Nguyen: Stay code up something, you got it kind of plan out what we want. Okay, so what we go we like to do is make you understand what you can do with a for loop. Okay, so let's say how how it works kind of thing, right. So,

526
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:12.090
Brian Nguyen: My idea when I built this is that you have, say, five directories, which one

527
01:04:17.850 --> 01:04:20.370
Brian Nguyen: He's a good kid.

528
01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:24.450
Brian Nguyen: So,

529
01:04:27.450 --> 01:04:29.190
Brian Nguyen: All right, and so

530
01:04:31.050 --> 01:04:31.380
This

531
01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:32.880
Brian Nguyen: Over

532
01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:41.190
Brian Nguyen: Today is they say you're in this folder here this directory here. Here's the hierarchy, they

533
01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.230
Brian Nguyen: Are here.

534
01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:44.700
Brian Nguyen: Ah,

535
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:50.760
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so this is the most highest level in directory. In each case, director, you're

536
01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:52.710
Brian Nguyen: There in this

537
01:04:53.730 --> 01:04:53.970
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

538
01:04:57.630 --> 01:04:57.930
All right.

539
01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:00.660
Brian Nguyen: And so you want to run

540
01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:04.440
Brian Nguyen: For loop.

541
01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:11.640
Brian Nguyen: Here. Okay. And he correctly.

542
01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:30.090
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so one thing that usually always can I competed at a llama students when I teach them a correlative I worked is that depending on where you run your for loop essentially just running your commands. Right. So sometimes when you're any calculation, you'll see later on in the future.

543
01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:39.030
Brian Nguyen: Some of the calculation gets treated right into you want to find a way to kind of script. All right. The normally you would, you know,

544
01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:47.190
Brian Nguyen: Make these directory. Okay. So quick question to you guys. What's the command for make directory

545
01:05:53.970 --> 01:05:54.270
Brian Nguyen: People

546
01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.560
Aakrsh: from n to

547
01:05:56.730 --> 01:06:03.660
Brian Nguyen: N K. Dr. Good say so. That's Nick directory. So you would say, Okay, I'm going to directly wind or or

548
01:06:04.890 --> 01:06:15.930
Brian Nguyen: I knew you would say, I'm gonna take them out to the to the front lines right and so on. So, for his kids. That's a lot of work great. Or you can probably type in

549
01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:26.370
Brian Nguyen: Make one two to five. Okay, or maybe sometimes and you have 100 Derek 300

550
01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:38.790
Brian Nguyen: You're going into each one each directly, one by one, and then you'll say touch this are great this file and a CD go periods back

551
01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:58.500
Brian Nguyen: And then go back to CD to attach files you know companies, same file again and we go to the back and so on so forth. Right. Quick question for people. I think I showed this already to highlight this what is CD. Period. Period for slash

552
01:07:02.550 --> 01:07:03.900
Brian Nguyen: Feel free to contribute, guys.

553
01:07:07.350 --> 01:07:09.480
Brian Nguyen: I know to show you guys all this, please don't forget

554
01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:12.870
To do that.

555
01:07:17.070 --> 01:07:18.570
Brian Nguyen: Don't use that technique enough but

556
01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:23.310
Brian Nguyen: I showed everyone just last week, I think, I hope.

557
01:07:26.070 --> 01:07:29.550
Brian Nguyen: A crazy time at this time, Victoria.

558
01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:34.890
Victoria Choi: Go back to home, the home.

559
01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:37.770
Brian Nguyen: The

560
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:39.240
Brian Nguyen: Home.

561
01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:43.260
thanh: It's simple back to

562
01:07:49.170 --> 01:07:51.240
thanh: Go back to something like before.

563
01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:51.960
Yeah.

564
01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:53.940
thanh: Yeah.

565
01:07:54.030 --> 01:08:03.840
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so let's say you're a directory was all right and say you want to go back to the directory. Ah. Alright do that you had to type cd

566
01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:08.490
Brian Nguyen: To get and go back to, you know, can you go back to you there.

567
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.870
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

568
01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:11.400
Brian Nguyen: Right.

569
01:08:12.930 --> 01:08:16.380
Brian Nguyen: There. The other thing to note, guys. All these things.

570
01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:24.780
Brian Nguyen: A lot of things we're talking about you guys. So keep in mind, take notes.

571
01:08:25.830 --> 01:08:27.630
Brian Nguyen: Okay, alright. So,

572
01:08:28.650 --> 01:08:41.010
Brian Nguyen: It helped me a lot when I was first learning this right and to question about Korea, we just typed in CD and you just type in CD and press Enter, that goes back to your home directory

573
01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:51.870
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so

574
01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:57.090
Brian Nguyen: So when you ever write a script. You gotta have in your mind.

575
01:08:58.140 --> 01:08:59.070
Brian Nguyen: What's your end goal.

576
01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:02.970
Brian Nguyen: The end goal of this we want

577
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.720
Brian Nguyen: To do is that we want to print out

578
01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:10.680
Brian Nguyen: And say for now we want to print out the

579
01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:15.150
Brian Nguyen: The destination of each of these fights. Okay.

580
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:25.050
Brian Nguyen: And then output it into A into a file. Okay, so what what we would probably do.

581
01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:31.260
Brian Nguyen: If you were to write this out one by one, right, is like what I said here.

582
01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:34.170
Brian Nguyen: Make directory

583
01:09:35.310 --> 01:09:49.620
Brian Nguyen: One here it's five. Okay. And I say CD one. And I'd say de de de right. Oh, I can echo dollar sign PWD

584
01:09:51.150 --> 01:09:54.570
Brian Nguyen: And then I say lesser than five.

585
01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:56.880
Brian Nguyen: Minutes unless again symbol.

586
01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:14.910
Brian Nguyen: So just remember that the lesser than symbol here signifies that kids are putting into the file. Okay. And I want to outplay it all into the same file. So I want to output it in the previous directory called destination.

587
01:10:16.770 --> 01:10:34.650
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so here's the little tricky stuff here. So you gotta keep in mind what's happening here right now you're in CD one and I'm going to echo out PWD but you will check out this file into a file called destination text, which is

588
01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:36.900
Brian Nguyen: In a

589
01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:40.860
Brian Nguyen: Directory. Do you see my mouse, just in case.

590
01:10:42.450 --> 01:10:44.790
Brian Nguyen: Over hovering over HP right

591
01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.710
Brian Nguyen: So that does that. And you go back one folder.

592
01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:51.870
Brian Nguyen: Right.

593
01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:59.010
Brian Nguyen: To go back into ed to do the same thing to test out. He doesn t

594
01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:06.240
Brian Nguyen: You see how this gets kind of repetitive thoughts. Right.

595
01:11:07.290 --> 01:11:19.170
Brian Nguyen: Imagine right now you have five directory that's not too many. But if you're not, you get to work with 20 or 30 folders in a row, like it's really pretty repetitive right but it's teach you how what happens

596
01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.240
Brian Nguyen: During the for that.

597
01:11:23.370 --> 01:11:33.720
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so I want you guys to set a goal for you guys is to come up, write a little script will spend a couple minutes only 510 minutes

598
01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:37.830
Brian Nguyen: In five minutes and how long you take write a for loop.

599
01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:45.000
Brian Nguyen: Script based on what you just learned so far are based on the commands. I just gave you

600
01:11:50.190 --> 01:11:53.490
Brian Nguyen: Are you output out the destination. Right.

601
01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.180
Brian Nguyen: DWP to this mission right

602
01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:04.740
Jeffrey Tsai: I was wrong. It's a greater than sign and then

603
01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:13.950
Jeffrey Tsai: If you want to go something and like appended to the end of file, you need to have double greater than sign

604
01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:15.630
Brian Nguyen: Ah,

605
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:17.130
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, I was.

606
01:12:17.610 --> 01:12:34.830
Brian Nguyen: I was going to show them that let them explore for themselves. But all right, yes. Yes, technically, so what what happened right I wanted you guys to kind of see this. You see what happened can troubleshoot later on. Alright, so, like so. So

607
01:12:36.090 --> 01:12:37.200
Brian Nguyen: Yes, so this is

608
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:40.050
Brian Nguyen: Double graders than science.

609
01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:42.870
Brian Nguyen: Okay, what I have here.

610
01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:50.940
Brian Nguyen: A single greater than it will essentially how put a new file every time. And so, erase your previous

611
01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:56.820
Brian Nguyen: These outer okay I wanted to show you guys that

612
01:12:58.350 --> 01:13:12.900
Brian Nguyen: So then you can guys can kind of trouble shoot yourself. Right. And so here we go. So you do you do double the work greater than it will still just essentially add more add more to your texts about overriding it. Okay.

613
01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:14.340
Brian Nguyen: All right.

614
01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:17.340
Brian Nguyen: You guys have questions here how to do it.

615
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:24.450
Brian Nguyen: Now I said she take this list of commands. How can you put it into a 40

616
01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:26.760
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

617
01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:30.090
So,

618
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:34.500
Brian Nguyen: How a crack at it. Yes.

619
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:38.430
Brian Nguyen: Sorry.

620
01:13:41.010 --> 01:13:45.240
Brian Nguyen: Questions in a nod. Let's give a thumbs up. Yes.

621
01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:11.430
Brian Nguyen: Okay. Alright, well, we'll break in there, take, you know, try to try script this up and then they see someone like to share dancer.

622
01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:38.850
Brian Nguyen: Oh yeah, you'll

623
01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:42.870
Brian Nguyen: Feel free to ask questions right

624
01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:39.960
Brian Nguyen: Good.

625
01:18:41.730 --> 01:18:44.940
Brian Nguyen: All right, now I think you got this or say something. Yeah.

626
01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:53.550
Brian Nguyen: Chris can very soon.

627
01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:02.040
Brian Nguyen: Okay, yeah, feel free.

628
01:19:08.190 --> 01:19:09.960
Brian Nguyen: To share. I just stopped sharing my

629
01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:30.090
Brian Nguyen: What's the question or issue.

630
01:19:32.670 --> 01:19:34.080
Theresa Carlos: Can I see an example.

631
01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:38.550
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

632
01:19:38.910 --> 01:19:39.180
Here.

633
01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:47.610
Brian Nguyen: Chris and Tom, do you have any questions.

634
01:19:49.470 --> 01:19:50.370
Brian Nguyen: You guys got a script.

635
01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:52.860
Brian Nguyen: Working

636
01:20:10.290 --> 01:20:10.530
Brian Nguyen: And

637
01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:15.630
thanh: I also think I got it. Could you just go over just

638
01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:24.210
Brian Nguyen: Share

639
01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:29.460
Brian Nguyen: You open my

640
01:20:38.490 --> 01:20:39.570
Brian Nguyen: Gifts today. Good, good.

641
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:43.650
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so

642
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:51.990
Okay.

643
01:20:54.690 --> 01:20:55.470
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so

644
01:20:57.390 --> 01:21:02.190
Brian Nguyen: I wanted to show you guys how for this kind of work and so

645
01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:06.030
Brian Nguyen: For the little confusing.

646
01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:09.450
Brian Nguyen: People looking for me to

647
01:21:10.650 --> 01:21:18.330
Brian Nguyen: First learn. So what I want to do you mean some time for them to be useful if you want to say.

648
01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:20.370
Brian Nguyen: Great.

649
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:26.370
Brian Nguyen: Let's say run some calculations because calculation are kind of repetitive write

650
01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:36.480
Brian Nguyen: Your copy this. Maybe once maybe eventually okay and you will essentially run the same command over and over again.

651
01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:50.820
Brian Nguyen: And so one very simple example is very simple example is, let's say you want to create five folders. Right. Each folder you want to do something in example. Right. So there is a general case here.

652
01:21:52.530 --> 01:22:07.050
Brian Nguyen: Is the general case, you'll create 100 folders, essentially, and then you just go into each folder runs a bunch of commands Snatcher selling this is not the only command, you're going to run it run a few more. Okay.

653
01:22:09.690 --> 01:22:22.500
Brian Nguyen: pay periods, just going to show you that there are a lot more commands you might be running in that book. Okay. And it can get kind of repetitive, right, because to run those command, you have to eat in those folders. Right.

654
01:22:23.790 --> 01:22:38.220
Brian Nguyen: And so you go back to zero to 42 so on so forth. And so that gets wasted, kind of, say, Wait, it can be inefficient use anytime you want to make it more efficient, the one way is to write a little script.

655
01:22:39.810 --> 01:22:43.800
Brian Nguyen: So I can can get you guys started okay

656
01:22:47.400 --> 01:23:07.230
Brian Nguyen: So one or a little script for the script that kind of repeats movies, man. All right there we know that if you do a for loop right away back an example before I there is some variable, you could find any variable you want, I can just put Brian Okay.

657
01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:08.820
Brian Nguyen: In

658
01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:34.320
Brian Nguyen: The end essentially just give you a list of stuff. You said you want to run or whatever this variable to represent okay we in our cases right now represent this variable as curly brace 125 okay this is equivalent has to writing 12345 okay

659
01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:59.040
Brian Nguyen: All right, separated by stages. Right. So if so essentially what this does is that it will say that this variable Brian will be representing will be number, number one, okay. And within loop through this list a number one by one call that's a call right

660
01:24:00.450 --> 01:24:01.080
Brian Nguyen: And so

661
01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:07.500
Brian Nguyen: And so the next example like Jeffrey show as you can do

662
01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:09.420
Brian Nguyen: That's very important.

663
01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:13.590
Brian Nguyen: Dollar sign Brian right

664
01:24:14.730 --> 01:24:16.830
Brian Nguyen: Say echo dollar sign, Brian.

665
01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:18.990
Brian Nguyen: Men done

666
01:24:20.010 --> 01:24:28.800
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so what the open this up to you guys. So what happens with it. This an echo dollar signs, Ryan.

667
01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:33.810
Brian Nguyen: Howard. Before we do that, what this echo one dude.

668
01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:37.770
Victoria Choi: It returns one

669
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:52.140
Brian Nguyen: Yes, correct. Victoria. So essentially echo out the number one inside the terminal. Okay. Now, going back to the for loop and ice cream kind of please answer this one. So what happens in this case.

670
01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:57.510
Brian Nguyen: We're echo, echo out dollar sign, Brian, or where echo out

671
01:25:01.110 --> 01:25:01.590
Brian Nguyen: And out

672
01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:05.280
Aakrsh: You can you make a note.

673
01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:07.650
Brian Nguyen: Out right so

674
01:25:09.450 --> 01:25:18.180
Brian Nguyen: Victoria says that he just had an echo one will return the number one inside your terminal okay is correct. I keep that in mind.

675
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:20.790
Brian Nguyen: We're here I have a for loop.

676
01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:37.650
Brian Nguyen: Brian variable and have this list of numbers 1234 and five okay to do and I say echo dollar sign Brian and then done by press enter and read my script will echo. The question is, will echo outdoor same Brian

677
01:25:39.390 --> 01:25:40.920
Brian Nguyen: Or or something else.

678
01:25:42.510 --> 01:25:47.490
Aakrsh: We want to take you back till I think you already did one won't take you back to number two.

679
01:25:48.690 --> 01:25:50.640
Brian Nguyen: Yes. So what the output will be

680
01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:59.100
Brian Nguyen: Will be so each mind, it will be actually out 1234 and five.

681
01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:03.150
Brian Nguyen: All right you guys see that

682
01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:07.530
Brian Nguyen: Does that make sense to a little bit more. What does

683
01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:11.850
Alright.

684
01:26:13.950 --> 01:26:24.270
Brian Nguyen: guys have questions there so that that makes a little sense, a little bit more sense. Right. So what we want to do. All right, is me create a script, where

685
01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:37.950
Brian Nguyen: We can go into each of these folders and echo out the PDP Wi Fi option instead. Okay, so just remember that this variable can represent whatever

686
01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:46.800
Brian Nguyen: You know lists of things. All right. And, you know, the thing that we're doing a we're taking advantage of what this variable is

687
01:26:47.850 --> 01:26:49.980
Brian Nguyen: Ok sense in this case.

688
01:26:51.210 --> 01:26:55.320
Brian Nguyen: We just quote conveniently named all our directories 1234 and five.

689
01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:01.170
Brian Nguyen: Technically, there might be more folders different names users needs to be

690
01:27:02.370 --> 01:27:08.130
Brian Nguyen: So for now, we can do. The first step is CD. CD, Brian.

691
01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:09.810
Brian Nguyen: Our site.

692
01:27:11.490 --> 01:27:17.580
Brian Nguyen: Okay, there's there's other ways of doing this to this is one way of the alright

693
01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:19.920
Brian Nguyen: So,

694
01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:24.420
Brian Nguyen: What's the next line.

695
01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:46.980
Brian Nguyen: Good, that's fine too. YES, THAT'S GOOD IDEA. Make the folders first. All right, good. Good catch.

696
01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:50.580
Brian Nguyen: All right, what's next.

697
01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:59.460
Brian Nguyen: Anyone else to add to this little script that we get, we're gonna wrap this up and I'll copy the same exact script into my terminal and see what's up.

698
01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:01.890
Right.

699
01:28:08.130 --> 01:28:09.000
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, go for it.

700
01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:14.700
Victoria Choi: Practice.

701
01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:35.700
Brian Nguyen: With everyone falling down.

702
01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:41.550
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so it says for this. Are you done here.

703
01:28:48.030 --> 01:29:01.350
Brian Nguyen: Are yall already done here. Well, what happened, what will happen. For example, if we make this directory you go into this folder. The Echo this out. And then we say, okay we're done, what were you guys people

704
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:10.350
Brian Nguyen: happy occasion time and

705
01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:24.930
Brian Nguyen: They will go step by step. All right.

706
01:29:27.090 --> 01:29:28.710
Brian Nguyen: There we create a file.

707
01:29:31.170 --> 01:29:36.330
Brian Nguyen: 12345 okay and he cd into one.

708
01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:37.740
Brian Nguyen: All right.

709
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:40.530
Brian Nguyen: And then we echo a file.

710
01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:44.970
Brian Nguyen: Into this destination techs right

711
01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:48.210
Brian Nguyen: Now, we didn't end there here.

712
01:29:49.290 --> 01:30:01.350
Brian Nguyen: We gotta keep in mind. Where are we right now in this script. Right. So if we were to be CD i right now in in the in the directory. Number one, okay. Now if we go back

713
01:30:03.090 --> 01:30:04.140
Brian Nguyen: Into this directory

714
01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:05.880
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

715
01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:15.630
Brian Nguyen: Go back to the for loop. All right. Well what happened is, then you didn't create another directory, Brian.

716
01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:19.200
Brian Nguyen: Because like iteration to

717
01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:23.490
Brian Nguyen: Keep in mind, you're now creating

718
01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:29.580
Brian Nguyen: An hour create another folder.

719
01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:35.970
Brian Nguyen: Inside to inside one and this folder would then be called to

720
01:30:39.930 --> 01:30:40.290
Brian Nguyen: Right.

721
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:42.360
Okay.

722
01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:52.170
Brian Nguyen: And then you then you echo that file again this destination file that destination and the ending up in one okay so

723
01:30:53.850 --> 01:30:57.750
Brian Nguyen: This is a common issue common mistake we all, we all make okay

724
01:30:59.070 --> 01:31:04.710
Brian Nguyen: There you have to do before you are done, you can see the Period. Period.

725
01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:07.830
Brian Nguyen: Victorious say alright

726
01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:11.520
Brian Nguyen: That essentially what he called completing delete.

727
01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:12.990
Brian Nguyen: All right.

728
01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:18.000
Brian Nguyen: Is that clear out something occasion in three so

729
01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:28.050
Brian Nguyen: It's not like kids to come up clap get

730
01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:29.370
Brian Nguyen: Chris

731
01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:40.770
Brian Nguyen: Give you a few minutes to get out.

732
01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:44.730
Brian Nguyen: And in time, he had a similar code like this.

733
01:31:46.530 --> 01:31:47.640
Brian Nguyen: Very impressive. Good job.

734
01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:49.230
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

735
01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:51.660
Brian Nguyen: All right.

736
01:31:56.010 --> 01:31:57.390
Brian Nguyen: All right, all right.

737
01:31:58.620 --> 01:31:58.980
Brian Nguyen: Good.

738
01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:09.690
Brian Nguyen: Feel free to ask questions don't hesitate to all the crew all in growing the same boat guys now.

739
01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.080
Brian Nguyen: Feel free to, you know, rock the boat.

740
01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:17.640
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

741
01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:20.850
Brian Nguyen: See this

742
01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:23.430
Brian Nguyen: Oh, yeah.

743
01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:28.590
Aakrsh: Good mission, Brian, I have a question.

744
01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:30.990
Brian Nguyen: Yes.

745
01:32:31.410 --> 01:32:32.010
Brian Nguyen: Or you can call it a

746
01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:35.550
Aakrsh: Try okay I wrote this

747
01:32:36.690 --> 01:32:42.420
Aakrsh: When I so I wrote this originally, but every time I try to run it, it just says error found

748
01:32:43.230 --> 01:32:58.470
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so how this is share your screen and we'll all look at it together. And I'll spot the air. And now once I want to see you guys tonight, Tricia and Victoria. You can see the air. Okay, friendship, share your screen for us.

749
01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:09.540
Jeffrey Tsai: There should be a green button at the bottom of the zoom window.

750
01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:22.020
Brian Nguyen: Command Shift PLUS YEARS. Dave

751
01:33:25.170 --> 01:33:25.800
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

752
01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:32.550
Aakrsh: Well, this was the one I originally wrote, but every time I try to run it in the air.

753
01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:36.540
Brian Nguyen: Okay. All right, good code.

754
01:33:41.610 --> 01:33:51.090
Brian Nguyen: Alright everyone, you guys think this looks good. That's exactly my code, right. Okay, so let's save this and let's get out of that you run it.

755
01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:55.230
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so, run it for me and then see what

756
01:34:00.690 --> 01:34:01.830
Brian Nguyen: It kept sending into

757
01:34:07.890 --> 01:34:10.110
Brian Nguyen: Ah permission denied.

758
01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:12.270
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

759
01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:18.660
Brian Nguyen: Do you

760
01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:21.630
Brian Nguyen: Ls

761
01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:28.020
Brian Nguyen: Space dash l the user permissions is related to

762
01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:33.840
Brian Nguyen: Memories okay so

763
01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:37.260
Brian Nguyen: Let's look at practice script.

764
01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:39.990
Brian Nguyen: One.

765
01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:51.150
Brian Nguyen: So remember that. So, okay, here's a I think we need to show this world it alright so

766
01:34:54.690 --> 01:35:00.090
Brian Nguyen: May you stop your screen share I'll share my screen now. So introduction to this.

767
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.990
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so this is, it's called current mission files. Okay.

768
01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:27.780
Brian Nguyen: So here's what you need to know. I'm gonna highlight this for you guys. I think I explain it to a few guys but not everyone. All right, though. Alright, have a filename Chinese words Chinese and Chinese I don't know enough money that a deer folders.

769
01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:45.180
Brian Nguyen: Like desktop and downloads. Right. And those are signifies that is the okay David LS dash l like is your other more information about the file right and permissions. Alright, so what each of these. Did they come in, essentially, come in.

770
01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:48.990
Brian Nguyen: groups of three. All right.

771
01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:58.980
Brian Nguyen: These files, right. So this one the first three are w x stands for read, write and execute

772
01:36:00.030 --> 01:36:16.260
Brian Nguyen: Execute. He basically running is running a code right it's allowing the user to do to edit the file ours to read the file as you know like how when you open up Microsoft Word is sometimes is a a week. Read Only file right

773
01:36:17.430 --> 01:36:21.000
Brian Nguyen: Okay. And so, in certain cases,

774
01:36:25.950 --> 01:36:27.270
Brian Nguyen: Right, my neighborhood.

775
01:36:30.570 --> 01:36:36.000
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so in these cases first three letters is you're

776
01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:47.640
Brian Nguyen: Essentially administration. Okay, like a admin for your computer. The next three is essentially you what permissions you have for this file.

777
01:36:48.330 --> 01:37:03.660
Brian Nguyen: And now, last three here. Essentially what permissions to allow other users on your computer to use just fine. Okay. So Chris, what he had was this one here are dash dash

778
01:37:04.650 --> 01:37:13.560
Brian Nguyen: Right in his bio, you look at the way he's missing is if you want to use it as an executable file to execute you need to do CH month

779
01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:21.180
Brian Nguyen: You plus X okay and that would then give him the correct R dash

780
01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:26.490
Brian Nguyen: I believe I should be missed. And in the file.

781
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:34.020
Brian Nguyen: Thank you from, I think,

782
01:37:41.010 --> 01:37:47.820
Brian Nguyen: Each of us each model essentially changes, the easier it changes the permissions for each of the

783
01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:55.260
Brian Nguyen: Each of these blocks, okay, if we all show you guys. You guys look up

784
01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:59.970
Brian Nguyen: So if that you may Mickey Mantle can use word here.

785
01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:11.400
Brian Nguyen: There's a numbering scheme. You have to look up online. And each of these add up to a certain number to speed up 777 you can each month.

786
01:38:12.630 --> 01:38:13.200
Brian Nguyen: And he works.

787
01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:21.060
Brian Nguyen: Alright so tonight. What this is our first copy it to say, we know what it looks like.

788
01:38:22.230 --> 01:38:31.620
Brian Nguyen: They just didn't change these permissions and will make all everybody to have rewrite execute clinicians. Okay, and you show you enter

789
01:38:36.630 --> 01:38:39.810
Brian Nguyen: That in any copies out the original one.

790
01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:41.970
Brian Nguyen: That makes sense now.

791
01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:52.350
Brian Nguyen: Alright so CH mod essentially change the permissions for that. I believe I don't remember exactly. I

792
01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:56.490
Brian Nguyen: Agree. So each of these number represents the

793
01:38:57.690 --> 01:39:04.170
Brian Nguyen: Each of the groups of five, three and three it done good example media to find out. Okay.

794
01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:07.440
Brian Nguyen: So I'll just copy this today. You guys know

795
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:09.930
Brian Nguyen: What we had written

796
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:13.950
Right, so that's

797
01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:15.630
Okay.

798
01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:17.490
Brian Nguyen: Right, so

799
01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:23.370
Aakrsh: Do I do, I do teach moon, you put accurate winning winning look number two.

800
01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:27.600
Brian Nguyen: So you first access shortcut and sadly

801
01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:34.200
Brian Nguyen: Exodus gives it gives all the permissions for executing right for all the groups.

802
01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:39.660
Brian Nguyen: This one gives you a bit more finer control numbers, kind of thing.

803
01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:47.520
Brian Nguyen: So that each group, you have a little bit more finer control of which group has permission. Okay.

804
01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:49.050
Brian Nguyen: All right.

805
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:53.490
Brian Nguyen: Questions.

806
01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:58.260
Brian Nguyen: It would be important later on. Okay. You can also

807
01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:04.080
Brian Nguyen: Just type out just type out back in the file.

808
01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:23.580
Brian Nguyen: dashes kinda century like the program and then it will just read the file indices. The first line. The she bang line you're going as you run desperate for you. Okay, the executable file making executable.

809
01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:27.720
Brian Nguyen: Makes it a little bit easier. You don't need to check it out.

810
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:29.220
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

811
01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:31.020
Brian Nguyen: All right.

812
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:38.610
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so

813
01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:45.180
Brian Nguyen: Questions there. Hope you guys understand a little bit more about that.

814
01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:46.740
Brian Nguyen: For you.

815
01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:57.690
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so, what time is 1035

816
01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:03.570
Brian Nguyen: Want to be open this up to you guys. You guys like to take the five minute break.

817
01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:05.250
Brian Nguyen: Come back.

818
01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:10.890
Brian Nguyen: Share we share we continued shopping along

819
01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:19.590
Brian Nguyen: It's open to everyone said let me know what you guys like you guys

820
01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:30.090
Brian Nguyen: You can return on occasion. Don't feel pressured

821
01:41:34.110 --> 01:41:38.580
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so I guess we'll continue on. I get I like this. I love this.

822
01:41:38.910 --> 01:41:39.960
Brian Nguyen: If you guys have here.

823
01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:41.250
Brian Nguyen: Hopefully, yeah.

824
01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:46.710
Brian Nguyen: Alright, Jeffrey. What's next on the list. I think you have the floor.

825
01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:50.640
You take care

826
01:42:04.170 --> 01:42:06.330
Jeffrey Tsai: SSH stands for Secure Shell right

827
01:42:09.210 --> 01:42:09.510
Brian Nguyen: Yes.

828
01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:14.070
Jeffrey Tsai: Alright, so, one of the nice things about

829
01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:15.810
Aakrsh: What

830
01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:23.550
Aakrsh: Can you make this bigger. Yeah.

831
01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:29.850
Jeffrey Tsai: Alright, so

832
01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:34.200
Jeffrey Tsai: We are unable to

833
01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:42.240
Jeffrey Tsai: Go from our current computer into another computer so

834
01:42:44.370 --> 01:42:47.520
Jeffrey Tsai: The command for that is SSH.

835
01:42:49.290 --> 01:42:57.120
Jeffrey Tsai: So I don't exactly know how this works. But if you use SSH and then you give

836
01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:01.140
Jeffrey Tsai: An address for

837
01:43:02.190 --> 01:43:03.090
Jeffrey Tsai: Another computer

838
01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:10.170
Jeffrey Tsai: You would be able to go into that computer and do whatever you want on there so

839
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:13.770
Jeffrey Tsai: Within this lab. The reason why we have

840
01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.990
Jeffrey Tsai: Why we usually use SSH is in order to go to

841
01:43:20.010 --> 01:43:22.890
Jeffrey Tsai: A cluster. So a cluster would be

842
01:43:24.210 --> 01:43:27.960
Jeffrey Tsai: A separate computer that will run all of our calculations for us.

843
01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:44.970
Jeffrey Tsai: So when we want to connect to that we would use SSH and the typical option that I would use here in order to make sure that it's a secure connection is Dash capital lie.

844
01:43:48.540 --> 01:43:54.810
Jeffrey Tsai: So you all should have received UCI that IDs that were sponsored by Brian

845
01:43:56.070 --> 01:44:03.300
Jeffrey Tsai: So if you want to connect to one of the computers in the artifact, which is a group of computers that we have

846
01:44:04.470 --> 01:44:05.970
Jeffrey Tsai: In our like physical lab.

847
01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:10.530
Jeffrey Tsai: You would write in your UCI ID.

848
01:44:11.970 --> 01:44:22.500
Jeffrey Tsai: And then the at is just making sure that the UCI that ID that you wrote here is going to be the username for whichever computer you're connecting to

849
01:44:24.690 --> 01:44:30.990
Jeffrey Tsai: So there are several different options that we have. You can pick any of them that you want to go into

850
01:44:32.250 --> 01:44:32.880
Jeffrey Tsai: So,

851
01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:39.780
Jeffrey Tsai: The modified the typical room there's like a separate room with like five different computers.

852
01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:45.690
Jeffrey Tsai: And those are models 4567 and eight.

853
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:51.240
Jeffrey Tsai: So if you want to connect to the one the models you can connect to any of those five

854
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:53.430
Jeffrey Tsai: We also have

855
01:44:54.810 --> 01:45:00.120
Jeffrey Tsai: Our own computers that are named after rivers. So there's Tigres

856
01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:04.920
Jeffrey Tsai: I don't know how to process.

857
01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:07.170
Jeffrey Tsai: That photo.

858
01:45:10.290 --> 01:45:10.470
And

859
01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:13.980
Jeffrey Tsai: This is all night are pronounced model.

860
01:45:18.330 --> 01:45:22.470
Jeffrey Tsai: So you can choose any of those names so models takers.

861
01:45:23.670 --> 01:45:28.410
Jeffrey Tsai: flogo mala so I'll do model six because that's what I used in my

862
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:30.330
Jeffrey Tsai: Class with Philip

863
01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:36.690
Jeffrey Tsai: So all of these modified computers their service by

864
01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:38.670
Jeffrey Tsai: A

865
01:45:40.410 --> 01:45:41.520
PS is

866
01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:45.540
Jeffrey Tsai: What was looking for. I know Pacific is like

867
01:45:46.950 --> 01:45:49.380
Jeffrey Tsai: The computer around some friends, the love, but

868
01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:52.740
Brian Nguyen: Yeah yeah vs sense with his for scientists

869
01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:57.300
Brian Nguyen: Anything after the X is your IP address.

870
01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:12.330
Jeffrey Tsai: So after the name we do period PS period. You see I period edu.

871
01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:14.280
Alright.

872
01:46:15.330 --> 01:46:17.340
Jeffrey Tsai: So if we click enter

873
01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:28.350
Jeffrey Tsai: There might be something that pops up for you that says like, do you actually want to connect to a second computer just type in yes and then press Enter.

874
01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:29.730
Jeffrey Tsai: Okay.

875
01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:40.050
Jeffrey Tsai: So all of you should also have a password associated with the UCI ID.

876
01:46:41.550 --> 01:46:52.650
Jeffrey Tsai: So you'll type it in here. One thing to take note of is on this kind of Secure Shell connection in order to make sure that people can't see what you're typing in

877
01:46:53.400 --> 01:47:05.940
Jeffrey Tsai: There's not even going to be any Asterix as asterisks that appear when you type it in to hide your password. It's just not going to show up at all. So as you're typing in your password which I am right now.

878
01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:08.820
Jeffrey Tsai: You'll see that nothing comes up.

879
01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:13.410
Jeffrey Tsai: But if I type to them and press Enter.

880
01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:18.600
Jeffrey Tsai: You should be able to enter the computer.

881
01:47:20.190 --> 01:47:23.250
Jeffrey Tsai: Let me know if any of you have any trouble with that art.

882
01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:26.640
Jeffrey Tsai: Or rather,

883
01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:36.960
Jeffrey Tsai: For those of you who are needed just unmute yourself really quick and go back to being muted to make sure to tell me that you've collected

884
01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:41.490
Aakrsh: You want to try

885
01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:44.610
Jeffrey Tsai: Sorry, what was that

886
01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:46.440
Aakrsh: You want to try to connect

887
01:47:47.670 --> 01:47:53.340
Jeffrey Tsai: Yeah, um, the stuff that we're gonna be doing is going to be within one of these computers.

888
01:47:54.990 --> 01:47:56.760
Brian Nguyen: Jeffrey, can you just have to computers.

889
01:48:02.310 --> 01:48:02.610
Hey,

890
01:48:03.630 --> 01:48:04.260
Chris

891
01:48:21.450 --> 01:48:22.920
Theresa Carlos: Someone else to listen.

892
01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:26.370
Theresa Carlos: To me.

893
01:48:34.410 --> 01:48:36.960
Jeffrey Tsai: Sorry, Brian, can answer that. I don't know, an email.

894
01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:46.650
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so I think you get the email Jeffrey, you got that email like a year ago as a long time ago. Right. So there are two

895
01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:56.220
Brian Nguyen: There are two two accounts to give me one is that we're giving you an account on which called TCP blogging.

896
01:48:57.930 --> 01:49:04.710
Brian Nguyen: On one, remember that is our cluster which is there are we caught it super computer like

897
01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:20.820
Brian Nguyen: Cluster if area supercomputer by like it's a place where we can actually run heavy calculations. All right. But in this case, we're giving you access to our own server in our group or you run internally.

898
01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:27.600
Brian Nguyen: And that server also has a bunch of computers in clusters because of server.

899
01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:49.470
Brian Nguyen: And so that one is where we run our lighter calculations. Okay. And so we want to use that in most cases. Okay, eventually, if you have some very expensive calculations or I mean like really big malls and stuff about like really big like proteins, for example, okay.

900
01:49:50.550 --> 01:50:05.460
Brian Nguyen: That's thousands of atoms. Okay, and need a very strong computer to run this calculation you would need to unplug cheeky logging one okay for now. We want you guys to log into our model.

901
01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:08.580
Okay.

902
01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:12.720
Brian Nguyen: So, I believe, Nate. EDU

903
01:50:14.430 --> 01:50:26.940
Brian Nguyen: passwords to go through them one of them says the cluster tester and one of the mod as. All right, Mr effect passwords, our computers model for for the eight to 12 and more down

904
01:50:28.050 --> 01:50:29.760
Brian Nguyen: The cluster is for to keep the login

905
01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:38.520
Brian Nguyen: I hope that answered your questions. All right. Can everyone tried to log into the month back to just hand over check against

906
01:50:40.830 --> 01:50:41.250
Victoria Choi: Oh,

907
01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:47.040
Victoria Choi: It says that the connection is refused for like Muslims

908
01:50:48.270 --> 01:50:48.660
Brian Nguyen: All right.

909
01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:57.150
Brian Nguyen: Good. All right. That happens. So what I think I explained this to a

910
01:50:58.620 --> 01:50:59.340
Brian Nguyen: Christian gone

911
01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:02.730
Brian Nguyen: I think I explained this to

912
01:51:05.490 --> 01:51:14.790
Brian Nguyen: You guys last week. So, so what happens is there's a firewall. I use guy. So keep in mind that we're all

913
01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:20.520
Brian Nguyen: We all trust you guys right so we're sharing this to you guys to be careful denied.

914
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:22.740
Denied after

915
01:51:23.790 --> 01:51:37.440
Brian Nguyen: Yes, I know you understand. So what happened is that there's a firewall. Right. And so how do you get get overcome that firewall. Use the VPN. So remember that thing, we said it last week on the VPN stuff.

916
01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:40.350
Aakrsh: I'm on the weekend.

917
01:51:41.310 --> 01:51:41.760
Okay.

918
01:51:44.190 --> 01:51:51.750
Brian Nguyen: So Victoria can increase that he's talking to VPN and Chris, I think you're using the Cisco VPN.

919
01:51:52.980 --> 01:51:53.220
Aakrsh: Yeah.

920
01:51:54.330 --> 01:51:55.590
Brian Nguyen: Okay, you've

921
01:51:55.650 --> 01:51:56.970
Brian Nguyen: successfully connected

922
01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:01.950
Brian Nguyen: It, um,

923
01:52:03.210 --> 01:52:06.660
Brian Nguyen: Maybe you try logging in. Now, see what happens.

924
01:52:07.230 --> 01:52:14.610
Aakrsh: Oh, I'm logging in, like, I'm in everywhere and it prints out my password and when everyone path through the permission denied please try again.

925
01:52:15.510 --> 01:52:17.850
Brian Nguyen: So that means that you didn't type in the password correctly.

926
01:52:19.770 --> 01:52:31.350
Brian Nguyen: Right. So with the mod fat client, it's, there's two parts to your email, there's a pastor for the cluster and there's a password for that month back me. Let me double check that, you know, you guys.

927
01:52:43.650 --> 01:52:54.060
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, so it would say your temporary password for the cluster is this law, your temporary password for the workstation. Sorry. It's called workstations. Okay. Is this the type that one.

928
01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:01.080
Right.

929
01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:05.280
Theresa Carlos: Yes.

930
01:53:05.550 --> 01:53:06.420
Brian Nguyen: Your temporary password.

931
01:53:27.660 --> 01:53:40.830
thanh: So whenever so it works so far, but like whenever I go on the VPN, it just like turns off to for me. So I'm going to switch over to my phone. So it works better.

932
01:54:03.030 --> 01:54:03.540
Brian Nguyen: All right, good.

933
01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:04.680
Right, so

934
01:54:06.990 --> 01:54:09.120
Brian Nguyen: Permission denied, please. Okay. Teresa.

935
01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:12.630
Brian Nguyen: De turn onto a Cisco VPN.

936
01:54:14.670 --> 01:54:20.820
Brian Nguyen: Okay so permission denied his decrees to boss dirty you type in the past screen. Correct.

937
01:54:22.890 --> 01:54:26.190
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so, so it's the workstation password.

938
01:54:27.570 --> 01:54:29.790
Brian Nguyen: Is whatever is in the apostrophe.

939
01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:37.800
Theresa Carlos: All time

940
01:55:33.870 --> 01:55:34.560
Theresa Carlos: I'm not sure.

941
01:55:36.630 --> 01:55:37.860
Brian Nguyen: Why not share screen.

942
01:55:40.590 --> 01:55:42.660
Brian Nguyen: Share screen and share your

943
01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:56.280
Brian Nguyen: If you're in

944
01:55:57.330 --> 01:55:58.410
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, you've been

945
01:56:00.270 --> 01:56:03.750
Brian Nguyen: You've been saving me, like, yeah, you've been in

946
01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:07.800
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, yeah, and how you model six kids to get

947
01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:13.860
Brian Nguyen: Right to say alright guys just pick your computers and stick to it for the rest of summer. Alright.

948
01:56:17.670 --> 01:56:23.220
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so I think Jeffrey need to change passwords. Right. Correct. So if you take over now.

949
01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:28.500
Jeffrey Tsai: I can cancel of change my password. Right.

950
01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:31.320
Brian Nguyen: Because

951
01:56:33.570 --> 01:56:34.320
I'd like to stick

952
01:56:43.170 --> 01:56:48.330
Jeffrey Tsai: Right, so you have the password that Nate gave you. So if you want to change it.

953
01:56:49.530 --> 01:56:52.050
Jeffrey Tsai: You can just type in past WD

954
01:56:55.140 --> 01:57:00.900
Jeffrey Tsai: So it will ask you for the kind of pass rates so you can input, what whatever your current password is.

955
01:57:03.870 --> 01:57:04.650
Should be

956
01:57:08.010 --> 01:57:09.810
That close the window right

957
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:23.340
Jeffrey Tsai: So once you type that in and then press Enter, it should be able to prompt you for a new password that you want. So just sent that to different secure password.

958
01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:25.200
Jeffrey Tsai: So,

959
01:57:26.940 --> 01:57:30.690
Jeffrey Tsai: Make sure that it's not something that's easily guest or easily

960
01:57:33.690 --> 01:57:34.320
Determined

961
01:57:36.750 --> 01:57:45.240
Jeffrey Tsai: So what I've been using is a mix of capital and lowercase letters few numbers as well as a special symbol.

962
01:58:01.260 --> 01:58:06.660
Jeffrey Tsai: Let me know if there is, let us know. Because friends and family be the one to fix it, but

963
01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:10.320
Jeffrey Tsai: Let us know if there's any trouble with doing that.

964
01:58:31.470 --> 01:58:31.710
Jeffrey Tsai: Good.

965
01:58:52.110 --> 01:58:55.680
Jeffrey Tsai: Right. I think after changing. Oh, well, we

966
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:57.570
Aakrsh: Want to do us a CP

967
01:59:30.330 --> 01:59:32.460
Jeffrey Tsai: For any one of them to copy file from

968
01:59:34.740 --> 01:59:39.120
Jeffrey Tsai: My truck over to their computer. Yeah, and

969
01:59:39.180 --> 01:59:42.330
Brian Nguyen: Vice versa, it's going to be important because I

970
01:59:54.660 --> 01:59:57.870
Jeffrey Tsai: Will be sleeping whichever file.

971
02:00:00.810 --> 02:00:08.190
Jeffrey Tsai: Username whichever computer their own data for the destination you use the ip address right

972
02:00:10.770 --> 02:00:11.340
Brian Nguyen: Yes.

973
02:00:12.510 --> 02:00:19.230
Jeffrey Tsai: Okay, I haven't actually SCP it anything before in this lab at least so

974
02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:21.630
Brian Nguyen: That's okay, we'll learn as we

975
02:00:21.630 --> 02:00:21.930
Go.

976
02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:42.030
Brian Nguyen: So this will be a very useful command at CERN program. So you want to use to visualize is downloaded on your computer. It's much easier to visualize on your computer in through a network. Okay.

977
02:00:47.910 --> 02:00:49.950
Jeffrey Tsai: So within model six

978
02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:52.320
Jeffrey Tsai: Brian

979
02:00:54.210 --> 02:00:54.720
See

980
02:00:56.640 --> 02:00:57.270
Jeffrey Tsai: So,

981
02:01:01.140 --> 02:01:06.750
Jeffrey Tsai: Let's just go into the documents directory. So change directories and documents.

982
02:01:09.150 --> 02:01:10.980
Jeffrey Tsai: And then we'll just create a file.

983
02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:15.330
Jeffrey Tsai: To copy over so we'll just call it file dot txt

984
02:01:16.860 --> 02:01:19.290
Jeffrey Tsai: And then we can go something into that.

985
02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:26.610
Jeffrey Tsai: So,

986
02:01:27.990 --> 02:01:35.490
Jeffrey Tsai: Because we're connected to a different computer right now. We can't just directly like copy of the file from that computer

987
02:01:38.820 --> 02:01:42.150
Jeffrey Tsai: And territory directory without using a CP

988
02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:49.440
Jeffrey Tsai: CP command is for secure copy

989
02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:51.300
Jeffrey Tsai: So it's

990
02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:59.160
Jeffrey Tsai: Just like the Secure Shell connection that we use in order to get into these computers, we want to use the secure copy in our to

991
02:02:00.450 --> 02:02:07.830
Jeffrey Tsai: Do the copying as well. So after scb will type in the name of the file that we want to move

992
02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:11.790
Jeffrey Tsai: And now our current

993
02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:16.950
Jeffrey Tsai: Directory that we're in.

994
02:02:18.780 --> 02:02:21.660
Theresa Carlos: The prisons and I can see

995
02:02:24.930 --> 02:02:26.820
Jeffrey Tsai: Oh, can you share your screen, please.

996
02:02:50.010 --> 02:02:51.780
Jeffrey Tsai: Ellis option. L.

997
02:02:55.230 --> 02:02:57.120
Jeffrey Tsai: Dash. Sorry, that's all.

998
02:03:07.890 --> 02:03:09.060
Jeffrey Tsai: Well, you don't need often say

999
02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:24.180
Brian Nguyen: Hey, we can just type in CD.

1000
02:03:28.470 --> 02:03:28.890
Brian Nguyen: W.

1001
02:03:32.070 --> 02:03:32.580
Brian Nguyen: WD

1002
02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:40.470
Brian Nguyen: Anyone else having the same issue.

1003
02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:42.150
thanh: Yeah.

1004
02:03:44.940 --> 02:03:45.210
Brian Nguyen: Can

1005
02:03:46.410 --> 02:03:47.100
Brian Nguyen: You scroll up

1006
02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:50.370
Brian Nguyen: For a three second scroll up

1007
02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:55.560
Brian Nguyen: That's it.

1008
02:03:58.170 --> 02:04:04.200
Brian Nguyen: I was trying to see, okay, I want to see the quite happy when you login to log out. Remember control deep

1009
02:04:05.010 --> 02:04:05.880
Brian Nguyen: Breath control and D.

1010
02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:10.710
Brian Nguyen: All right, he log back in as a second

1011
02:04:30.210 --> 02:04:32.940
Brian Nguyen: ps, ps, ps. But you see, I

1012
02:04:36.510 --> 02:04:37.440
Brian Nguyen: could catch a

1013
02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:44.130
Brian Nguyen: Donkey. Yeah, it's fine.

1014
02:04:47.970 --> 02:04:49.950
Brian Nguyen: All right, all right. I remember now.

1015
02:04:53.070 --> 02:04:53.700
Brian Nguyen: I'm

1016
02:04:54.840 --> 02:05:00.660
Brian Nguyen: Uh, yeah, I didn't. I guess I didn't check with you guys on logging into the workstation. Sorry about that.

1017
02:05:01.770 --> 02:05:03.810
Brian Nguyen: Chris has gone there.

1018
02:05:08.010 --> 02:05:10.140
Brian Nguyen: I didn't check the workstation with you guys.

1019
02:05:11.460 --> 02:05:13.560
Brian Nguyen: Looks like that will get that makes

1020
02:05:15.900 --> 02:05:20.940
Brian Nguyen: Me see here. So I want to see the options. The documentation of law.

1021
02:05:26.580 --> 02:05:27.660
Brian Nguyen: Okay, can you let

1022
02:05:37.380 --> 02:05:41.160
Jeffrey Tsai: Me also try LS space dash a

1023
02:05:42.180 --> 02:05:43.050
Jeffrey Tsai: See if they're hitting

1024
02:05:53.280 --> 02:06:00.450
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so don't worry about this if everyone seen this, the same thing where you get all locking different computers.

1025
02:06:01.980 --> 02:06:02.910
Brian Nguyen: Can stop sharing now.

1026
02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:10.350
Brian Nguyen: Is everyone else locked into their own computer a computer to

1027
02:06:12.630 --> 02:06:14.070
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so what computer dx.

1028
02:06:16.170 --> 02:06:17.130
thanh: Model for

1029
02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:18.240
Orange.

1030
02:06:19.980 --> 02:06:20.550
Victoria Choi: Simon

1031
02:06:21.960 --> 02:06:23.220
Brian Nguyen: Oh, yay.

1032
02:06:24.900 --> 02:06:44.970
Brian Nguyen: All right. Don't worry about, oh, get that fixed send an email to Nate and he should get traffic. Okay, so for now. I think you can still you still copy files back and forth should be fine. Jeffrey, I think we should copy files from my local computers that she'll be easier.

1033
02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:49.380
Jeffrey Tsai: Local computer or over it. Oh yeah, it's gonna be a lot

1034
02:06:50.310 --> 02:06:50.730
Easier.

1035
02:06:51.780 --> 02:06:57.540
Jeffrey Tsai: Okay. Otherwise, if the destination is our own computer what we put in the IP address.

1036
02:06:59.490 --> 02:07:00.300
Jeffrey Tsai: From the past

1037
02:07:01.530 --> 02:07:04.410
Brian Nguyen: You need a name and an IP address, you have to look at

1038
02:07:06.030 --> 02:07:07.140
Brian Nguyen: That little bit difficult.

1039
02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:09.840
Brian Nguyen: View. The other way I learned

1040
02:07:10.260 --> 02:07:10.590
Brian Nguyen: This

1041
02:07:11.130 --> 02:07:12.000
In your own computer.

1042
02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:14.550
Jeffrey Tsai: If you log out.

1043
02:07:15.810 --> 02:07:20.850
Jeffrey Tsai: Of the SSH and then you log back in. They'll tell you. Oh well.

1044
02:07:21.810 --> 02:07:28.050
Brian Nguyen: As it's not worried about that. I think it's easier to just as a CP on your local computer

1045
02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:36.930
Jeffrey Tsai: If you need your IP address. Yeah, if you walk in, again, you'll see this at the end. Right. So let's go back.

1046
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:41.730
Jeffrey Tsai: So if you want to close your connection.

1047
02:07:42.990 --> 02:07:45.150
Jeffrey Tsai: Just press Control or Command.

1048
02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:47.280
Brian Nguyen: Is I think

1049
02:07:47.610 --> 02:07:48.570
Brian Nguyen: In our control the

1050
02:07:49.110 --> 02:07:49.980
Brian Nguyen: map looks as good

1051
02:07:56.940 --> 02:07:57.990
Jeffrey Tsai: You should be logged out

1052
02:08:09.990 --> 02:08:10.290
Jeffrey Tsai: Okay.

1053
02:08:19.290 --> 02:08:22.740
Jeffrey Tsai: Everyone in their documents folder. Are you back in your home directory

1054
02:08:26.010 --> 02:08:29.640
Jeffrey Tsai: Okay so well Sep one of these files.

1055
02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:33.450
Jeffrey Tsai: Let's just do the for them file.

1056
02:08:37.890 --> 02:08:40.710
Jeffrey Tsai: So Sep and then the name of the file that you want to copy over

1057
02:09:03.930 --> 02:09:05.430
Jeffrey Tsai: France, the current period.

1058
02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:51.210
Jeffrey Tsai: Destination.

1059
02:09:55.410 --> 02:09:56.730
Jeffrey Tsai: Destination is the

1060
02:09:58.110 --> 02:09:58.620
Perfect.

1061
02:10:02.130 --> 02:10:04.320
Brian Nguyen: Path, you know, to be home directory

1062
02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.220
Brian Nguyen: So when you login login here under a tree.

1063
02:10:11.250 --> 02:10:11.550
Jeffrey Tsai: Okay.

1064
02:10:19.230 --> 02:10:23.760
Jeffrey Tsai: Okay, so like as from here, we'll just put in our username again.

1065
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:29.400
Jeffrey Tsai: And then the name of the computer that we want to connect it to that we want to

1066
02:10:30.540 --> 02:10:31.830
Jeffrey Tsai: Send the file over to you.

1067
02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:35.910
Jeffrey Tsai: Now we'll have a colon.

1068
02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:39.150
Jeffrey Tsai: Is

1069
02:10:42.540 --> 02:10:53.130
Jeffrey Tsai: Alright, so if we want to copy it into the home directory on this computer. So after the column will put in the path to whichever directory. Want to put forth

1070
02:10:54.420 --> 02:10:59.610
Jeffrey Tsai: So we saw earlier when we connected

1071
02:11:02.010 --> 02:11:02.430
You can use

1072
02:11:05.730 --> 02:11:06.540
Brian Nguyen: You can use till now.

1073
02:11:08.700 --> 02:11:12.180
Brian Nguyen: Or just a period. Okay, so just so everyone knows

1074
02:11:13.380 --> 02:11:27.960
Brian Nguyen: When you log in, you log into your home directory. Right. And so he did put a tool that signifies signifies the home directory or period, which means that because you're entering the home directory and locking

1075
02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:11.370
Jeffrey Tsai: Alright, so after SSH King, you can check out for coffee then correctly.

1076
02:12:13.740 --> 02:12:14.700
Jeffrey Tsai: And yeah.

1077
02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:20.370
Hi.

1078
02:12:21.810 --> 02:12:22.650
Jeffrey Tsai: Everyone sees file.

1079
02:12:27.270 --> 02:12:28.410
Okay, awesome.

1080
02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:37.950
Jeffrey Tsai: I think that's the end for what we want to do on the mod pack so next would be Green Planet.

1081
02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:46.950
Brian Nguyen: I think I think he said, I'll take over this one right

1082
02:12:51.690 --> 02:12:52.350
Brian Nguyen: Give me a second.

1083
02:13:12.630 --> 02:13:14.160
Brian Nguyen: Background noise. Good.

1084
02:13:15.480 --> 02:13:25.170
Brian Nguyen: Right, so that's just that. So we was everyone able to copy their file to the most effective for you, Chris, I had

1085
02:13:26.340 --> 02:13:27.030

Brian Nguyen: So can everyone just talking to

1092
02:14:00.060 --> 02:14:01.260
Brian Nguyen: Talking to Green Planet.

1093
02:14:14.790 --> 02:14:15.330
Brian Nguyen: Log into

1094
02:14:17.580 --> 02:14:18.990

02:14:56.730 --> 02:14:57.390
thanh: Like the

1107
02:14:57.840 --> 02:14:58.140
Script

1108
02:15:10.860 --> 02:15:11.280
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

1109
02:15:24.270 --> 02:15:25.590
Brian Nguyen: Feel free to ask questions.

1110
02:16:01.770 --> 02:16:07.800
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so, removing that I can move move a little bit faster right to feel free to stop me.

1111
02:16:08.970 --> 02:16:11.340
Brian Nguyen: OK, now go back to terminal.

1112
02:16:15.090 --> 02:16:21.240
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so right now I'm back home, my home, my local computer because my computer here.

1113
02:16:22.860 --> 02:16:27.630
Brian Nguyen: So you guys can see me as I've already changed your password. So what we're gonna do is go back

1114
02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:42.600
Brian Nguyen: To my new local machine or open a new tab, who's eight like the McAfee from McAfee naked little tap on your feet on the terminology told me to leave on

1115
02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:45.960
Top

1116
02:16:55.920 --> 02:16:56.160
Brian Nguyen: Oh,

1117
02:16:57.960 --> 02:16:58.200
Brian Nguyen: Right.

1118
02:17:01.800 --> 02:17:02.580
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so

1119
02:17:03.930 --> 02:17:07.230
Brian Nguyen: That was the same thing, Sep board. All right.

1120
02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:26.790
Brian Nguyen: And then so it's just 30 guys know SAP is the same thing at CP but SAP is allows you to copy stuff from one computer to another. Okay. Exactly. For priceless. All right, for the role did the same thing with Jeffrey to showed you

1121
02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:33.720
Theresa Carlos: And I'm sorry the case that you can say, I

1122
02:17:35.010 --> 02:17:39.000
Brian Nguyen: Dominate us a period because I know that when you lock in the home directory

1123
02:17:40.140 --> 02:17:41.040
Brian Nguyen: And other

1124
02:17:42.780 --> 02:17:46.680
Brian Nguyen: It will be useful in the future you will know that, you know,

1125
02:17:47.850 --> 02:17:53.100
Brian Nguyen: This can be anything. You know, it could be like documents. Right, right. Some file.

1126
02:17:54.690 --> 02:17:59.250
Brian Nguyen: For research or something of that right. So this is an example away, it will

1127
02:18:00.810 --> 02:18:05.760
Brian Nguyen: copy the file team for that too, so that all right.

1128
02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:14.850
Brian Nguyen: For our purposes, we're going to copy this to the home directory. Alright. Okay.

1129
02:18:19.260 --> 02:18:21.060
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so it basically tell you

1130
02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:22.470
Brian Nguyen: passed over

1131
02:18:37.980 --> 02:18:43.230
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so you see my files, fair, right. So what we're going to do is

1132
02:18:45.330 --> 02:18:50.760
Brian Nguyen: Keep this in mind. Alright, so we scroll up with it. Okay.

1133
02:18:52.050 --> 02:19:03.090
Brian Nguyen: There are stirring stirring things need to know. Alright, so here's the Green Planet cluster. You've been running some calculation. GERALD. Learn how to submit a calculation to he's cluster.

1134
02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:05.970
Brian Nguyen: Or bunch of computers.

1135
02:19:07.890 --> 02:19:09.840
Brian Nguyen: Three. So you have a question.

1136
02:19:14.940 --> 02:19:16.080
Brian Nguyen: I can't hear you.

1137
02:19:25.020 --> 02:19:28.410
Brian Nguyen: I can't hear you. But can you hear me.

1138
02:19:30.120 --> 02:19:32.130
Jeffrey Tsai: I think you can just me.

1139
02:19:32.580 --> 02:19:33.870
Brian Nguyen: Okay, there's something wrong.

1140
02:19:35.100 --> 02:19:35.790
Brian Nguyen: Here is like it.

1141
02:19:41.250 --> 02:19:42.090
Brian Nguyen: Can't hear anyone

1142
02:19:42.630 --> 02:19:45.420
Brian Nguyen: What a shame. You say, Okay, this

1143
02:20:01.860 --> 02:20:02.940
Brian Nguyen: Can someone say something

1144
02:20:09.210 --> 02:20:11.760
Brian Nguyen: Oh, shoot. Oh my.

1145
02:20:17.130 --> 02:20:19.170
Brian Nguyen: Man technical difficulties, he said.

1146
02:20:19.500 --> 02:20:20.580
Brian Nguyen: All right, this happens.

1147
02:20:26.460 --> 02:20:27.300
Brian Nguyen: I'll be right back.

1148
02:20:34.950 --> 02:20:35.370
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1149
02:21:04.890 --> 02:21:06.060
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so I want to say something.

1150
02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:09.120
You

1151
02:21:10.470 --> 02:21:12.480
Brian Nguyen: Know, happy here. Okay.

1152
02:21:16.110 --> 02:21:16.770
Brian Nguyen: Well then.

1153
02:21:18.210 --> 02:21:22.110
Brian Nguyen: I'm gonna come back zillion carefree take over.

1154
02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:25.320
Brian Nguyen: I'll be back.

1155
02:21:41.880 --> 02:21:45.150
Jeffrey Tsai: Unfortunately, I don't, I don't know how to text.

1156
02:21:51.180 --> 02:21:53.070
Aakrsh: I can still

1157
02:21:56.400 --> 02:22:01.530
Aakrsh: Every like I've even like change my password but every time it gets permission.

1158
02:22:13.980 --> 02:22:19.350
Jeffrey Tsai: You try to save the file or actually SSH answer.

1159
02:22:20.670 --> 02:22:25.590
Aakrsh: No I don't, I can't even get into my computer and. Oh, OK.

1160
02:22:27.660 --> 02:22:29.490
Brian Nguyen: OK, I can hear you guys again.

1161
02:22:30.570 --> 02:22:38.040
Brian Nguyen: I think I have been was when I use the open a Cisco VPN it messed up my zoom thing, I think,

1162
02:22:38.100 --> 02:22:47.220
Aakrsh: That's what, that's what happened to meet you. Like, I couldn't hear anything until I left, I turn the VPN off, but because of that. I can't get into the

1163
02:22:48.720 --> 02:22:53.820
Brian Nguyen: Okay, well, what will fix the after class right okay so

1164
02:22:56.310 --> 02:22:57.960
Brian Nguyen: Go to your best to follow along.

1165
02:22:59.910 --> 02:23:00.960
Brian Nguyen: Coming into East

1166
02:23:02.250 --> 02:23:03.930
Brian Nguyen: Teresa, what was your question.

1167
02:23:04.890 --> 02:23:06.090
Theresa Carlos: No, I hadn't mentioned

1168
02:23:09.360 --> 02:23:09.600
Theresa Carlos: Yeah.

1169
02:23:12.120 --> 02:23:19.380
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, that's the, that's the best answer for me, you know, having your students answer your own question.

1170
02:23:20.550 --> 02:23:22.770
Brian Nguyen: He great crowd. Yes. Good.

1171
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:29.850
Brian Nguyen: Alright so okay let me go back to my, you know,

1172
02:23:32.790 --> 02:23:36.750
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so now he is the terminal.

1173
02:23:39.300 --> 02:23:48.540
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so you can see notes. Here are a few lock in notes. You can use up talking to people logging.

1174
02:23:50.340 --> 02:23:52.350
Brian Nguyen: In using the same more or less.

1175
02:23:54.210 --> 02:23:55.860
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so each

1176
02:23:57.540 --> 02:24:06.660
Brian Nguyen: When you log in, you enter your home directory each of your home directory has a quota, meaning that there's a limitation to how much data you can store.

1177
02:24:07.530 --> 02:24:24.840
Brian Nguyen: On the home directory, because this home directory is backed up. Alright, so if anything happens for some reason to your computer crashes or something, you have a backup for your, your data, right, but there's only 20 gigabyte limit right 100

1178
02:24:26.100 --> 02:24:33.360
Brian Nguyen: So this is often only used to back up. Maybe a few data files and things like that. So what we want you to use

1179
02:24:33.720 --> 02:24:34.440
Brian Nguyen: Was take note.

1180
02:24:35.040 --> 02:24:52.230
Brian Nguyen: Of this you want you to use this to data file right DFS dash l and DNS be okay to take note of that. Everybody logged in with this will show up every time so you won't run calculations always on your conversation baseball. All right.

1181
02:24:54.450 --> 02:24:56.430
Brian Nguyen: Josh elledge is for long term storage.

1182
02:24:56.910 --> 02:24:59.250
Aakrsh: Fees for short term storage. Okay.

1183
02:25:03.870 --> 02:25:10.980
Brian Nguyen: Just things to note is this extra data green plant isn't free. It costs money to kind of keep

1184
02:25:11.130 --> 02:25:11.880
Brian Nguyen: Things like that, but

1185
02:25:12.420 --> 02:25:19.260
Brian Nguyen: Just don't worry about that because it doesn't cost that much money right I ran a calculation on a

1186
02:25:19.260 --> 02:25:20.040
Brian Nguyen: Protein

1187
02:25:20.340 --> 02:25:24.660
Brian Nguyen: And about 70,000 items every single day.

1188
02:25:24.900 --> 02:25:25.470
Brian Nguyen: For a month.

1189
02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:31.860
Brian Nguyen: And the bill was about $4 so don't worry about the costs are it

1190
02:25:31.980 --> 02:25:34.410
Brian Nguyen: Will basically cover it right

1191
02:25:35.190 --> 02:25:35.430
So,

1192
02:25:36.540 --> 02:25:41.070
Brian Nguyen: Going back there for a loop, though, are we want to submit the calculation.

1193
02:25:41.310 --> 02:25:42.390
Brian Nguyen: To the computers.

1194
02:25:42.420 --> 02:25:42.780
Brian Nguyen: On

1195
02:25:43.020 --> 02:25:46.590
Brian Nguyen: The planet. So we have our for loop here, right.

1196
02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:51.510
Brian Nguyen: Now you want to copy that or missing move it.

1197
02:25:52.530 --> 02:25:52.860
To

1198
02:25:54.150 --> 02:25:54.960
Brian Nguyen: The DFS

1199
02:25:56.130 --> 02:25:57.270
Brian Nguyen: To do this because

1200
02:25:57.600 --> 02:26:00.990
Brian Nguyen: It's not much Ada for a

1201
02:26:01.110 --> 02:26:01.380
Start

1202
02:26:03.300 --> 02:26:03.480
Brian Nguyen: Up.

1203
02:26:03.690 --> 02:26:04.740
A next step. The next step.

1204
02:26:08.490 --> 02:26:12.210
Brian Nguyen: Ms that supposed to be nd file first

1205
02:26:14.940 --> 02:26:29.430
Brian Nguyen: And the last one is the destination or the path. Is this the way we want to move it to if you press tap a couple of times. I think I showed this a couple of people. This is way to like write everything, all in one line. Okay.

1206
02:26:31.290 --> 02:26:41.310
Brian Nguyen: So you can see the tap a couple of times to name should be there, you're using it should be there so Christian there. The Tanya their

1207
02:26:42.630 --> 02:26:46.350
Brian Nguyen: Target air okay ok to use your username.

1208
02:26:50.190 --> 02:26:50.610
Aakrsh: Enter.

1209
02:26:51.750 --> 02:26:52.350
Brian Nguyen: Ls

1210
02:26:53.550 --> 02:26:57.240
Brian Nguyen: Yet before you file, it's gone. And let's go into that folder.

1211
02:27:04.710 --> 02:27:05.130
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1212
02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:10.860
Brian Nguyen: Okay, yeah, we're gonna make this directory all. See ya.

1213
02:27:12.060 --> 02:27:12.330
Brian Nguyen: Know,

1214
02:27:14.250 --> 02:27:14.550
Brian Nguyen: For

1215
02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:35.550
Brian Nguyen: Underscore and when you make a folder. Whatever you do, do not use a space tried to connect everything with like underscore dashes. All right. But if you do this, you will think that you're agreeing to two different folders and I'll show you an example here.

1216
02:27:38.100 --> 02:27:53.580
Brian Nguyen: Right. But that's not where you wanted you to I believe if you want to be spaces, little more difficult, but when you do the first fourth backslash episode here some sort of that.

1217
02:27:57.360 --> 02:27:58.500
Brian Nguyen: Right, okay.

1218
02:28:00.030 --> 02:28:14.610
Brian Nguyen: That's a little bit more complicated and a little confusing to us. So my suggestion is to connect spaces with underscores with dashes. All right, we'll just call it for ages okie he

1219
02:28:19.770 --> 02:28:23.820
Brian Nguyen: Will do the same thing to make one more directory inside of the first

1220
02:28:26.340 --> 02:28:27.660
Brian Nguyen: So he will call it

1221
02:28:29.910 --> 02:28:30.210
Brian Nguyen: Art

1222
02:28:31.980 --> 02:28:36.180
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, he wants to see that. All right. We'll move for the

1223
02:28:38.190 --> 02:28:38.520
Brian Nguyen: First

1224
02:28:45.720 --> 02:28:46.560
Brian Nguyen: Stop right there.

1225
02:28:51.030 --> 02:28:53.370
Brian Nguyen: Faster, because I think it gets

1226
02:28:55.230 --> 02:28:55.560
Brian Nguyen: Loaded

1227
02:28:57.450 --> 02:29:01.050
Brian Nguyen: Right, so you're using all the skills you learned just earlier this morning. All right.

1228
02:29:09.270 --> 02:29:10.410
Brian Nguyen: Feel free to stop me.

1229
02:29:11.580 --> 02:29:12.390
Brian Nguyen: Ask me questions.

1230
02:29:13.830 --> 02:29:19.590
Brian Nguyen: All right, I'm going to be moving like see direction right okay so

1231
02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:23.910
Brian Nguyen: Let's look at our for loop.

1232
02:29:25.350 --> 02:29:36.030
Brian Nguyen: I don't remember exactly. I think it's the fourth and we wrote. Okay, we're going to run this script. Right. But what we can do is we're going to run this script by some a calculation.

1233
02:29:37.170 --> 02:29:41.340
Brian Nguyen: Mistake too many instead of just running. Alright, so

1234
02:29:42.870 --> 02:29:48.000
Brian Nguyen: What we can do is we're going to see a candy cane permission for this.

1235
02:29:55.470 --> 02:29:55.860
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1236
02:29:57.240 --> 02:30:14.550
Brian Nguyen: All right, so let's let's find out how to submit a calculation on how to select calculation, we have a close knit script and that's in this group is where you request. How much, how many nodes and the CPUs are so I need to

1237
02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:21.810
Brian Nguyen: Give you an idea what the show of what we mean by notes. Me give you a picture.

1238
02:30:23.190 --> 02:30:27.330
Brian Nguyen: All right, so imagine what we call is, this is what

1239
02:30:29.760 --> 02:30:31.380
Brian Nguyen: Up the planet.

1240
02:30:33.510 --> 02:30:35.970
Brian Nguyen: Because the way

1241
02:30:37.170 --> 02:30:42.390
Brian Nguyen: The way I understand it. I'm going to scan explain it to you guys. So when I say nodes.

1242
02:30:43.680 --> 02:30:49.680
Brian Nguyen: Nodes are like this, and each node there are you know CPUs.

1243
02:30:50.820 --> 02:30:51.750
Brian Nguyen: Maybe to these are

1244
02:30:53.430 --> 02:30:53.700
Brian Nguyen: Now,

1245
02:30:59.460 --> 02:31:06.690
Brian Nguyen: Alright, and there can be up to almost 20 a bunch of CPU in there. And this is what we call a new

1246
02:31:10.410 --> 02:31:10.770
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1247
02:31:12.570 --> 02:31:19.650
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so when I refer to notes I referred to basically a computer with a bunch of CPUs. Okay.

1248
02:31:22.020 --> 02:31:26.700
Brian Nguyen: So for every know there's certain number of CPUs for certain number of memory. I

1249
02:31:28.620 --> 02:31:28.920
Brian Nguyen: Got it.

1250
02:31:30.090 --> 02:31:32.340
Brian Nguyen: Okay and process that alright

1251
02:31:33.480 --> 02:31:48.750
Brian Nguyen: guys have questions there. This is really quick. And I think terminology. When I say nodes is essentially like a computer with a bunch of CPUs. Right. And these computers are dedicated to just run the calculations.

1252
02:31:49.830 --> 02:31:51.030
Brian Nguyen: All right. Okay.

1253
02:31:52.170 --> 02:31:53.040
Brian Nguyen: Stop share here.

1254
02:31:55.800 --> 02:31:57.630
Brian Nguyen: And go back to my terminal.

1255
02:31:59.760 --> 02:32:01.770
Brian Nguyen: All right. Okay, here's my for loop.

1256
02:32:02.970 --> 02:32:06.270
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so we're going to need to get our summit script.

1257
02:32:07.350 --> 02:32:15.750
Brian Nguyen: To get our summit script CP, CP, we have a copy of this, we made a template of this. So the CV mod fat.

1258
02:32:17.550 --> 02:32:18.150
Brian Nguyen: Cetera.

1259
02:32:19.650 --> 02:32:25.710
Brian Nguyen: All right, miss the rest of what's in there that we could do tap you can type person tap a couple of times.

1260
02:32:26.850 --> 02:32:44.490
Brian Nguyen: You'll see a few of these files. Right. And so all these are called run some scripts. All right. And these are different programs and gals any empty, you can, you know, the one we want is the one is the turtle mobile. All right, man.

1261
02:32:48.720 --> 02:33:00.300
Brian Nguyen: Alright. So Neil little quiz for you guys. So I want to copy this file from to the folder that I was in week one. How do I do that.

1262
02:33:02.610 --> 02:33:04.320
Brian Nguyen: What's it. What's the destination chef, but

1263
02:33:09.690 --> 02:33:11.190
Brian Nguyen: I just want to make sure you can hear anyone

1264
02:33:14.370 --> 02:33:14.520
Brian Nguyen: Else.

1265
02:33:14.730 --> 02:33:15.360
Jeffrey Tsai: Going on here. Yeah.

1266
02:33:16.380 --> 02:33:17.700
Brian Nguyen: I mean I can I hear you guys

1267
02:33:19.350 --> 02:33:22.410
Brian Nguyen: I get I can hear you. Alright, so

1268
02:33:24.450 --> 02:33:29.820
Brian Nguyen: As you guys guys question quiz time. Don't worry about this.

1269
02:33:32.670 --> 02:33:33.570
Brian Nguyen: What should I put there.

1270
02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:41.400
Aakrsh: CP

1271
02:33:44.910 --> 02:33:49.140
Brian Nguyen: CP is the command I use it here. That's correct. Right.

1272
02:33:50.160 --> 02:33:51.330
Brian Nguyen: That's correct. I

1273
02:33:52.950 --> 02:33:57.300
Brian Nguyen: Why I wanted to do, is I'm copying this file runs learn caramel.

1274
02:33:58.410 --> 02:34:05.160
Brian Nguyen: Basically what this does is that I'm pointing it. So this thing here, this extra thing here. I'm pointing it

1275
02:34:06.210 --> 02:34:15.840
Brian Nguyen: To this folder and saying copy this file. Okay, so it's slightly a little bit different than what we usually do in the past so

1276
02:34:18.180 --> 02:34:33.960
Brian Nguyen: Since since we're talking from a different folder. You want to do it this way. Okay, so this is an idea, different way of looking at it. Alright, so now once we specify the file we want. So I want to do is, how do I copy this folder here.

1277
02:34:39.300 --> 02:34:42.960
Brian Nguyen: You know, to delight information to recruit me into your green so

1278
02:34:49.620 --> 02:34:53.400
Jeffrey Tsai: So I was we are currently in the week one directory

1279
02:35:00.180 --> 02:35:03.120
Brian Nguyen: Time. Remember that answer that you gave last night.

1280
02:35:05.940 --> 02:35:07.530
Brian Nguyen: Our meeting and I was like,

1281
02:35:12.360 --> 02:35:12.690
thanh: No.

1282
02:35:14.670 --> 02:35:15.330
Brian Nguyen: I'm so

1283
02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:20.040
Brian Nguyen: What if I press this period will do that.

1284
02:35:36.510 --> 02:35:42.060
Brian Nguyen: Is anyone else anyone else is free to answer this question. Sorry to call you out.

1285
02:35:49.530 --> 02:35:52.950
thanh: I don't know what the period does, but do we put W.

1286
02:35:56.010 --> 02:35:56.490
Brian Nguyen: W.

1287
02:35:59.160 --> 02:36:10.020
Brian Nguyen: W Q is used used for them or via right. Remember to save or quick. OK.

1288
02:36:11.400 --> 02:36:12.330
Brian Nguyen: OK, Mary that

1289
02:36:13.590 --> 02:36:17.040
Brian Nguyen: But W Q technically that would kill you have to view.

1290
02:36:18.660 --> 02:36:21.810
Brian Nguyen: Colon W. All right. That's one way.

1291
02:36:23.250 --> 02:36:25.920
Brian Nguyen: It will basically save inputs are saving

1292
02:36:28.470 --> 02:36:29.910
Brian Nguyen: Out like okay

1293
02:36:31.860 --> 02:36:38.610
Brian Nguyen: Each each each mentor each graduate student has a different way of showing things so you will you'll pick up things, you know,

1294
02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:44.580
Brian Nguyen: So yes, tell me to is to write them so period.

1295
02:36:46.830 --> 02:37:04.200
Brian Nguyen: What that does is, then we are in the current directory right now, which is this thing right here, we highlight right what period does take note of this you will come up many times and only because you guys in the future. This and

1296
02:37:05.340 --> 02:37:14.160
Brian Nguyen: How to do it. The period will copy this file once learn about thermal into this folder. Okay, let's see what happens.

1297
02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:16.740
Brian Nguyen: Voila.

1298
02:37:18.060 --> 02:37:23.070
Brian Nguyen: OK, so now let's take some time and try to

1299
02:37:25.380 --> 02:37:33.090
Brian Nguyen: Okay, read the script, what is real. Okay, so let's fitness VI or them into runs

1300
02:37:35.010 --> 02:37:35.640
Brian Nguyen: Terrible mom.

1301
02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:37.980
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1302
02:37:39.870 --> 02:37:46.680
Brian Nguyen: All right, so you see that the very first nine fishy bang it shows that is a bash script.

1303
02:37:48.090 --> 02:37:55.470
Brian Nguyen: Okay. All this is essentially what you just learned earlier today, just a little bit more fancier right here somewhere options.

1304
02:37:56.850 --> 02:38:04.440
Brian Nguyen: I will send an email about this. There's documentation on how to submit these these scripts. Okay.

1305
02:38:06.150 --> 02:38:16.500
Brian Nguyen: You guys want to know a little bit more, but I wanted to show you guys is how how to submit a calculation and what options to change. Alright, so here is he just dropped me

1306
02:38:17.640 --> 02:38:25.230
Brian Nguyen: Okay, this is where you change your title. Right. So will you insert will change. It will call it for you.

1307
02:38:28.410 --> 02:38:28.710
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1308
02:38:29.910 --> 02:38:38.190
Brian Nguyen: We'll escape. Okay, so this is changing the name to every time you submit your job. Don't have a name. And you can kind of track calculation see

1309
02:38:39.390 --> 02:38:39.780
Brian Nguyen: See

1310
02:38:41.160 --> 02:38:41.880
To see the

1311
02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:54.510
Brian Nguyen: How long the calculation is running. Okay, so here this next one is competition, which is or call notes right and they are different nodes. Alright.

1312
02:38:55.020 --> 02:39:11.400
Brian Nguyen: So here is the name of all the different partition and actually 1.9 IO GT three any yesterday morning as to provide the RPT right and these are different processors painting and this kind of speed of ratios.

1313
02:39:12.570 --> 02:39:23.670
Brian Nguyen: Sorry, this means the number of course alright per nodes to that means there are about eight to 12 course for next semester. That means that you can

1314
02:39:24.510 --> 02:39:39.390
Brian Nguyen: Run your calculation in parallel. So when I say in parallel and mean. So how many CPUs are going to be used to run that calculation. Right. But we just need form right but if you want the board specified um

1315
02:39:41.340 --> 02:39:44.340
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so what we didn't choose partition, you're actually any. Yes.

1316
02:39:45.840 --> 02:39:46.170
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1317
02:39:50.820 --> 02:39:51.420
Brian Nguyen: Going

1318
02:39:53.370 --> 02:40:03.330
Brian Nguyen: Alright, here's some of the options is they were request some of the computer power. Do you want notes. It's numbers computers we want so for now.

1319
02:40:04.170 --> 02:40:26.370
Brian Nguyen: We only use this one right task per node number number of CPUs for note for a job since it's very easy, very quick or just use one all right for memory four gigabytes is a lot. There's not much our calculation. Not much, much most calculation was probably around four to eight gigabytes.

1320
02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:31.020
Brian Nguyen: Of memory is the total memories that people at

1321
02:40:32.040 --> 02:40:36.900
Brian Nguyen: The calculation me. So what I mean by memory is the

1322
02:40:40.020 --> 02:40:52.050
Brian Nguyen: Yellow Pages. Here we have is our go to much better than saying to me that allows you to store string calculations and to access that calculation very quickly.

1323
02:40:53.160 --> 02:40:59.340
Brian Nguyen: So the more memory you give the calculation generally that will can help with this female population. Okay.

1324
02:41:00.840 --> 02:41:09.960
Brian Nguyen: And then time is the first one is not a time you want to give it three. The first one is three hours hours, minutes, and seconds. Okay.

1325
02:41:11.130 --> 02:41:16.260
Brian Nguyen: And we only need that much hours. I was like, you know, 10 minutes. Okay.

1326
02:41:19.050 --> 02:41:19.260
Brian Nguyen: Yeah.

1327
02:41:21.030 --> 02:41:21.360
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1328
02:41:23.250 --> 02:41:25.110
Brian Nguyen: Going, going, going,

1329
02:41:26.190 --> 02:41:31.410
Brian Nguyen: But it's some more options comments you thing to note, like when you see a hashtag.

1330
02:41:32.580 --> 02:41:34.530
Brian Nguyen: Here, it means to comment out

1331
02:41:35.730 --> 02:41:44.310
Brian Nguyen: So that means that when you run your strip, you will not be that right and kind of ignored by line. OK. OK. I mind.

1332
02:41:46.770 --> 02:41:47.850
Brian Nguyen: Here's where you want to

1333
02:41:49.260 --> 02:41:50.580
Brian Nguyen: Edit your, your file.

1334
02:41:51.690 --> 02:42:03.630
Brian Nguyen: So what we want to do is blue modified this script here, this little old feared also like a little bit more. And what you guys to do right delete that and leave this here.

1335
02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:12.300
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so I'll explain that later on. What this means modular why I want to finish mostly show you guys is to have some completion.

1336
02:42:13.530 --> 02:42:13.770
Brian Nguyen: OK.

1337
02:42:15.690 --> 02:42:18.660
Brian Nguyen: And it will actually return come back to this later on.

1338
02:42:21.540 --> 02:42:34.110
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so this is not what we want. So here's the commands that we wanted to set up right on. So what we're gonna do is comment this out. Okay, injured.

1339
02:42:35.910 --> 02:42:38.640
Brian Nguyen: Unable to hear slack slash for

1340
02:42:40.470 --> 02:42:58.920
Brian Nguyen: Okay, so what does he said you submit this calculation in the directory. If you want to run this calculation and that same contract in that same folder to run that file. So essentially the script will basically run fast. Okay, questions here. Let's stop right there.

1341
02:43:05.940 --> 02:43:07.770
Brian Nguyen: I breeze through this pretty quick. So

1342
02:43:12.660 --> 02:43:13.860
Brian Nguyen: All right here.

1343
02:43:14.880 --> 02:43:16.170
Brian Nguyen: So we'll have to escape.

1344
02:43:17.850 --> 02:43:20.310
Brian Nguyen: Then we'll save this and I believe

1345
02:43:22.320 --> 02:43:24.060
Brian Nguyen: Jeffrey show something interesting.

1346
02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:37.380
Brian Nguyen: Interesting, right, so that every said shifts easy right so sad. Save it. So I think I show a few other students, you know, who do. Right. Thank you.

1347
02:43:38.850 --> 02:43:41.100
Brian Nguyen: break this down and saying you want to exit.

1348
02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:43.620
Brian Nguyen: Stage. Right.

1349
02:43:46.320 --> 02:43:46.830
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1350
02:43:50.190 --> 02:43:52.380
Brian Nguyen: Actually, one last thing we want to do.

1351
02:43:53.790 --> 02:43:55.710
Brian Nguyen: Is create that will lead to disagree.

1352
02:43:57.240 --> 02:44:05.400
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so what we then do is we're going to submit our calculation for what it's going to do is we look at for loop.

1353
02:44:06.660 --> 02:44:21.720
Brian Nguyen: Will essentially run this for for us make this file and create this destination. Okay, we'll do it. We'll do it really quickly. Right. So what am I need to do. I'm gonna look at one more command I forgot to add

1354
02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:27.450
Brian Nguyen: One second.

1355
02:44:52.590 --> 02:44:52.980
Brian Nguyen: Sorry.

1356
02:45:03.570 --> 02:45:06.270
Brian Nguyen: So we go back to her run some scripts.

1357
02:45:07.290 --> 02:45:09.120
Brian Nguyen: Okay, I want to add one last thing.

1358
02:45:11.820 --> 02:45:18.750
Brian Nguyen: We're going to have this call speed command. Okay. And we have put it for three minutes.

1359
02:45:19.980 --> 02:45:27.990
Brian Nguyen: OK, so the reason why I want to do this is I want to show that you can kind of keep track of all your calculations. All right.

1360
02:45:29.130 --> 02:45:33.270
Brian Nguyen: Because the scripts can run really quickly and will end really quickly so

1361
02:45:34.560 --> 02:45:52.080
Brian Nguyen: I just want to give you guys time to do the preparation. Okay so escape. Let's save that. Alright, so now let's submit our calculation. So the way to submit your calculation in here is called s batch.

1362
02:45:54.030 --> 02:45:54.630
Brian Nguyen: When slim.

1363
02:45:58.410 --> 02:46:01.620
Brian Nguyen: Alright, I will press ENTER yet. Let's see if everyone

1364
02:46:02.910 --> 02:46:05.580
Brian Nguyen: Can give me a nod that they got to this stage.

1365
02:46:07.140 --> 02:46:08.370
Brian Nguyen: I think Teresa in

1366
02:46:09.780 --> 02:46:11.640
Brian Nguyen: Victoria you nodding Teresa.

1367
02:46:12.870 --> 02:46:13.260
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1368
02:46:15.030 --> 02:46:16.530
Brian Nguyen: All right. Good, good, good, good.

1369
02:46:17.640 --> 02:46:30.150
Brian Nguyen: All right, and submitted to see what happens. Alright, so we have some at the calculation, boo. It gives you a ID number s batch right job ID. So what we want to do you want to see what our job is doing.

1370
02:46:31.110 --> 02:46:47.970
Brian Nguyen: This current status type in this command plus years. And in that use the username and here is wha, you see that your calculation is running right here. And this is a way to track your calculations. All right, so it will be FAQ

1371
02:46:49.050 --> 02:46:52.410
Brian Nguyen: On five. Oh, this one.

1372
02:46:53.670 --> 02:46:53.940
Brian Nguyen: Okay.

1373
02:46:55.440 --> 02:47:00.810
Brian Nguyen: These other users that please keep track of your calculations like that. Okay.

1374
02:47:02.790 --> 02:47:05.700
Brian Nguyen: I've ever ever can see the calculation. Right.

1375
02:47:06.960 --> 02:47:07.320
Brian Nguyen: Good.

1376
02:47:08.430 --> 02:47:08.910
Brian Nguyen: Alright.

1377
02:47:10.230 --> 02:47:13.410
Brian Nguyen: So angel LS to give you some information.

1378
02:47:14.460 --> 02:47:30.240
Brian Nguyen: There is some work note, here's a slim directory. Okay. This kind of gives you more information where your calculation is and ideas. The way it works is that it will copy this folder into this this computer here and then run that calculation. All right.

1379
02:47:33.750 --> 02:47:36.060
Brian Nguyen: Since I put it for three minutes.

1380
02:47:39.900 --> 02:47:42.810
Brian Nguyen: Take some time and she approaches for two minutes or something.

1381
02:47:43.980 --> 02:47:44.010
Okay.

1382
02:47:46.530 --> 02:47:49.470
Brian Nguyen: guys have questions about so many calculations on Green Planet.

1383
02:47:54.960 --> 02:47:58.020
Brian Nguyen: And there's a lot. This will be very useful in the future.

1384
02:48:02.280 --> 02:48:21.330
Brian Nguyen: Alright, so since this calculations, taking a while and we know that script is already ran the one thing is to can't something you want to cancel ago mean that you invest UP SOMETHING YOU KNOW THAT DR fail and you don't want to waste resources. So we can do typing s cancel.

1385
02:48:23.700 --> 02:48:26.460
Brian Nguyen: And then copy the job ID number.

1386
02:48:29.670 --> 02:48:30.660
Brian Nguyen: And then that will

1387
02:48:33.210 --> 02:48:33.930
Brian Nguyen: Be a user

1388
02:48:34.950 --> 02:48:35.940
Brian Nguyen: I will cancel your job.

1389
02:48:42.090 --> 02:48:49.200
Brian Nguyen: Good. Alright. Easy now, you ll well it does, does he ran the script for you.

1390
02:48:51.090 --> 02:48:56.850
Brian Nguyen: Yeah, because now you're asking a computer to do this job for you. Right.

1391
02:48:58.200 --> 02:49:00.720
Brian Nguyen: And so you did a look at destination.

1392
02:49:03.630 --> 02:49:06.240
Brian Nguyen: See here is alright.

1393
02:49:07.890 --> 02:49:16.440
Brian Nguyen: So the way it works is that it's running the calculations work folder, the username is the job ID. And then this is the name of the story.

1394
02:49:17.700 --> 02:49:18.060
Brian Nguyen: All right.

1395
02:49:21.300 --> 02:49:21.960
